10.1007/s10270-021-00908-8,Model-driven engineering for mobile robotic systems: a systematic mapping study,"Inclusion criteria:

- IC1: Studies applying MDE methods or techniques for MRSs. We consider the definition of methodology, given by [62], as a set of methods and techniques, possibly supported by a tool.
- IC2: Studies focusing on MDE for MRSs analysed from a software engineering for robotics perspective. For example, we do not consider studies that cite MDE as a background, but actually focus on other aspects, such as mechanical or electrical engineering.
- IC3: Studies including a kind of evaluation or validation of the proposed MDE method or technique. For example, realworld software projects, empirical examples, case study, experiment, formal analysis.
- IC4: Peer-reviewed studies: journal papers, workshop papers, conference papers.
- IC5: Studies written in English.
- IC6: Studies are available in full text.

Exclusion criteria:

- EC1: Secondary literature studies.
- EC2: Tutorial papers, short papers, poster papers, editorials, books, keynotes, tutorial summaries, tool demonstrations and panel discussions, books, introductory papers for books and workshops, technical reports, and any non peer-reviewed publication.
- EC3: Studies not in the scope of software engineering for robotics.
- EC4: Studies published before 2000. Since MDE is generally regarded to be born after the OMG standard for the model-driven architecture proposed in 2000.
","The paper is included, if all inclusion criteria match. If the paper matches any exclusion criteria, it is excluded."
