Internet-Based Self-Services: From Analysis and Design to Deployment,"Cardoso, Jorge;Miller, John A.",Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE First International Conference on Services Economics,2012,ACM,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,"Proceedings - 2012 IEEE 1st International Conference on Services Economics, SE 2012",2012-10-01,10.1109/SE.2012.8,2-s2.0-84866659574,EA | MDD | MVC | PaaS | Self-services | Service architecture | Service design | Service engineering,"Many worldwide economies have moved away from manufacturing and became service-oriented. As a consequence, research on Internet-based Self-Services (ISS) will foster the uptake of service exports and trading since they can replace many face-to-face interactions and make service transactions more accurate, convenient and faster. Currently, ISS are poorly supported since they are created using generic software techniques and development methods. Systematic methods are needed and must go beyond service design, a well established research area, to account also for service analysis, implementation, and deployment. In this paper, we explore a systematic development approach, called SEASIDE, based on four scientific advances: enterprise architectures (EA), model-driven developments (MDD), model-view-controller pattern (MVC), and platform as a service (PaaS). By selecting the Incident Management service from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, we have evaluated our approach. Our research indicates that the proposed method enables to focus on the business and design side of services, and reduce development time and costs. © 2012 IEEE."

The paper focuses on the contextual aspects and the working principles of AIMM. Furthermore, the paper deals with the design principles and overall hardware and software architectures of ""Little Helper"" from a functional and modular mechatronics point of view, in order to create a generic AIMM platform. The design challenges faced in the project is to integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and dedicated highly integrated systems into an autonomous mobile manipulator system with the ability to perform diverse tasks in industrial environments. We propose an action based domain specific communication language for AIMM for routine and task definition, in order to lower the entry barriers for the users of the technology. To demonstrate the ""Little Helper"" concept a full-scale prototype has been built and different application examples carried out. Experiences and knowledge gained from this show promising results regarding industrial integration, exploitation and maturation of the AIMM technology."

Based on the private information retrieval (PIR) theory and location k-anonymity model, we propose a new privacy preserving model, called (k, R, r)-anonymity, which is a light-weight and personalized resolution that can be implemented on mobile terminals. Main idea of the proposed model is to replace the user's real location and the query target by a specific area and a set of location types, respectively. A user may control his privacy preserving degree according to his specific demand by dynamically adjusting parameters of the proposed model, such as query contents, the size and location of the anonymous region, etc. Taking the nearest neighbor query as example, we evaluate performance of the proposed model and make a brief comparison with k-anonymity and PIR. Results show that the proposed model provides stronger anonymity protection than k-anonymity, whereas it its simpler and induces less additional overheads than PIR. In addition, it does not need a third-party privacy anonymity server either."

Because this robot is an under-actuated system, the uncertainty of the inertial parameters of the load strongly affects the resultant motion and reduces the control accuracy because of the dynamics interference. However, to date, the dynamics of this robot has not been thoroughly elucidated. Thus, this study analyzes the dynamics of a PWDR that controls three degree-of-freedom using two wires and an active balancer. Moreover, based on the dynamic analysis, a model-based adaptive controller for the parameter uncertainty of a load is proposed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation."

It is challenging to estimate a volume represented by an extremely high number of voxels with a small number of measurements. Yet many applications are time-critical and/or limited on resources, precluding extensive measurement collection. In this paper, we then propose an approach based on Markov random field modeling, loopy belief propagation, and sparse signal processing for 3D imaging based on wireless power measurements. Furthermore, we show how to design efficient aerial routes that are informative for 3D imaging. Finally, we design and implement a complete experimental testbed and show high-quality 3D robotic through-wall imaging of unknown areas with less than 4% of measurements."

Routing protocols whose operation considers the nodes’ positions use routing information updated according with the reception frequency of hello messages. The routing information can help to improve the routing to can include several metrics such as vehicle’s trajectory, vehicles’ density, percentage of packet losses, among others. There is a trade-o with the beaconing frequency: a high frequency provides a better accuracy in the selection of the next forwarding node to route a packet, but the overload increases due to a higher number of hello messages in the network. To decrease the overhead, the period of hello messages should be larger, although the eciency to choice the next forwarding node decreases. In this paper we have designed an ecient method to improve the accuracy of the nodes’ position used to select the next forwarding node. Our approach improves the operation of the routing protocol used in our performance evaluation. Simulations show the benets of our proposal, increasing the accuracy of the nodes’ selection and maintaining a same level of overhead, without the necessity to increase the beacon frequency."

Many middle schools have not yet implemented tech curriculum to prepare students for their almost inevitable interactions with computers in the workplace, and give them a chance to explore technology careers at an early age. The work presented in this paper is a research case study conducted in the form of building a unique cell-bot learning framework (CLF) themed educational module and its usage in an effort to contribute towards the middle school IT computing curriculum. Existing literature on robotics based tech curriculum for young children indicate that there have been multiple instances of curriculum design and development work at the K-12 level, involving robotic kits like LEGO Mind-storm, Bee-bots, Sphero robots. However, to our knowledge, the BERO robotic device has never been used for producing robotic technology curriculum at the middle school level. In this paper, we propose a nifty workshop module, which utilizes the unique CLF themed BERO. Our lesson plan is specifically designed for introducing mobile robotics and functional programming to middle school youth using music, thereby providing a fun and interactive experience in tech computing education. We expose our young workshop participants to the tech skills of programming a BERO and making it dance to music using a Microssoft Excel spreadsheet."

This planner is implemented in Flavors and is based on the Blackboard Control Architecture. which separates the domain specific issues from the control issues of a problem solving effort. This separation allows the planner to reason about what strategies to apply during the problem solving exercise. The control subsystem allows the planner to adopt one of two planning strategies according to an input parameter in the mission specification.

This work explores the value of relationships as a purposeful technique for achieving goals when no established process exists, issues are complex, or resources are scarce - scenarios which are all too familiar in Information Technology. A brief literature review sets the stage for gaining a better understanding of what drives various college and university environments and their organizational behavior models. Bases of Power are addressed as an academic concept related to influence tactics and their expected outcomes. Coupling an understanding of Higher Education cultural settings, power, and influence tactics we will examine how university decisions are made, and practical methods for directing those decisions towards desired outcomes within IT and throughout the campus communities we support. The value of relationships as an influence technique is established and strategies for how and when to cultivate relationships are discussed as they pertain to staff in diverse roles, from front-line support to CIO. Washington University in St. Louis is provided throughout this work as an example of an ""Organized Anarchy"" behavioral model where many semi-autonomous units exist, and actions are many times only loosely coupled to results."

As all system parts (control algorithms, software infrastructure, I/O, and machine) influence each other, its total behaviour needs to be taken into account. Therefore, we use appropriate modelling formalisms, namely discrete event / discrete time for the control software and algorithm part, and differential equations for the machine / robotics part. We combine these two types of models in a co-modelling approach, supporting co-operative design of such cyber-physical systems. In this paper, the co-modelling and co-design approach is elaborated. It consists of four major steps, whereby the models in each are verified via simulation or co-simulation. It is a pure model-driven design approach, implying that all final code is generated from these verified models. This allows for better quality of the resulting embedded software. The method is illustrated using a case study. Structuring models and verification by simulation, whereby relevant simulations are set up such that they can be repeated as real experiments, is beneficial for the design work itself, i.e. making it far more effective and less error-prone."

Existing (global) analysis techniques tend to mandate every domain-specific application to unveil all private behaviors for scientific collaboration. In practice, it is infeasible for a domain-specific application to disclose its process details (as a private workflow fragment) for privacy or security reasons. Consequently, it is a challenging endeavor to coordinate scientific workflows and its distributed domain-specific applications. To address this problem, we propose a collaborative scheduling approach that can deal with temporal dependencies between a scientific workflow and a private workflow fragment. Under this collaborative scheduling approach, a private workflow fragment could maintain the temporal consistency with a scientific workflow in resource sharing and task enactments. Further, an evaluation is also presented to demonstrate the proposed approach for coordinating multiple scientific workflow executions in a concurrent environment. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

One of the possible solution to deal with the changes in these systems is using patterns. Three patterns for self-adaptive cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been presented in previous work: Synthesis Utilize Pattern, Synthesis Command Pattern, and Collect Organize Pattern. To determine the energy efficency and data traffic generated by those CPS patterns, we run a simulation of the three CPS patterns where results are collected, discussed, and generalized. The result shows that the Synthesis Command Pattern requires less energy consumption when compared to the other two patterns. The Collect Organize Pattern, instead, results to be the most efficient in terms of distributing logic. Thee architecture reveals about the accuracy in the solution drawn from the Synthesis Utilize Pattern which is higher than that of the other two, due to the presence of duplicate data transfer in real time from different components. The Synthesis Utilize and Collect Organize Patterns seem to be the more suitable for engineering autonomous systems where the components can be self-organized according to embedded logic or different sensors associated with the components."

Vector quantization (VQ), is a well-known compression technique which has been widely used in many speech and image coding systems. Techniques for codebook design attempt to produce a codebook that is optimum for a given source. To date, the most widely used technique for VQ codebook design is the LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray) algorithm. Madeim et al. (1999) show that an unsupervised neural network algorithm, referred to as SOA (self-organizing algorithm), provides good VQ codebooks, leading to reconstructed signals with better quality when compared to the ones obtained by using LBG codebooks. In this paper, an investigation is carried out to evaluate the ""inherent"" quality of SOA and LBG codebooks regarding the computational complexity of medium distortion encoding. The present work shows that the SOA codebooks overperforms the LBG codebooks in the sense that they yield a smaller average number of multiplications per sample for image VQ. © 2000 IEEE."

Specifically, by exploiting an often overlooked technique, i.e. The Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) technique, a solution of adequate granularity for the electromagnetic device may be attained while still obeying a faster time commitment when compared to the simulation standard for electromagnetic devices, the finite element analysis (FEA) technique. This paper proposes a benchmarking study considering MEC, FEA, and Fourier series based inductance approximation differential equation modeling methods.

This paper develops a model to allow the variability of real-life driving profiles of railway vehicles to be quantitatively described and predicted, in order to better account for the effects on the speed profile of the train and hence the performance of the railway network as a whole.

This behavior is achieved through an adaptation process that takes into account contextual information such as capabilities of the accessing terminal and network, user profile and preferences, current application's goals, and information about the surrounding environment (e.g., geographical location, nearby resources, and available services). Context-awareness is a key issue for the design and implementation of truly adaptive applications. However, due to the absence of de facto supporting models and platforms, context-awareness has been incorporated into existing applications in an ad-hoc way.

Many approaches simply support crop watering as a simple standardised solution - watering the fields uniformly. However, depending on the topology of the ground and the crop species that exists, considerable improvements can be achieved that can greatly impact on the overall crop yield. Too little watering or too much watering in the wrong areas can impact the overall output. With the rapid growth in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones, image capture technology is now readily available. If the water-stressed areas could be identified, irrigation systems could offer targeted irrigation to only those crops in need. To support this, a crop water stress monitoring system has been designed utilising the thermal images of the crops. The analysis of such data can be computationally demanding when large crop fields are considered, hence the system has been designed to use multi-core high performance computing and Cloud-based systems. This paper outlines the requirements and design of the crop water stress monitoring system and how it provides an efficient and effective analysis of crop water stress index. The paper also benchmarks the algorithms across the hybrid infrastructure."

Positioning is one of the key challenges in realizing AD, where global navigation systems (GNSS) is traditionally used as an important source of information. The area of GNSS are well explored and the different sources of error are deeply investigated. However the existing modeling methods often have very comprehensive requirements for the training data where all affecting conditions such as ephemeris data should be well known. The main goal of this paper is to develop a solution to model GPS error that only requires information which is available in the vehicle without having access to detailed information about the conditions. We propose a statistical generative model using autoregression and Gaussian mixture models and develop a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters using the data collected in real traffic. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing the produced artificial data with the validation data collected at different traffic conditions and the results indicate that the model is successfully mimicking the sensor behavior."

We present an alternative approach to hint design focusing on player experience rather than performance. We had 25 participants play a difficult spatial puzzle game and collected player behavior, demographics, and self-reported player experience measures. We found that more exploratory behavior improved player experience, so we designed three types of hints encouraging this behavior: Adaptive, automatic, and on-demand. We found that certain players found hints more helpful regardless of whether the hints changed their behavior, and players seemed to prefer seeing fewer hints than the adaptive and automatic conditions gave them. Our findings contribute a deeper empirical understanding of hint design strategies and their effect on player behavior and experience, with practical recommendations for designers of interactive systems."
A Data-Mining Technique for Aerosol Retrieval Across Multiple Accuracy Measures,"Radosavljevic, Vladan;Vucetic, Slobodan;Obradovic, Zoran","Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, IEEE",2010,IEEE,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2010-04-01,10.1109/LGRS.2009.2037720,2-s2.0-77951208625,Aerosol retrieval | Metalearning | Neural networks,"A typical approach in supervised learning is to select an accuracy measure and train a predictor that maximizes it. This can be insufficient in remote-sensing applications where predictor performance is often evaluated over multiple domain-specific accuracy measures. Here, we test the hypothesis that predictors can be trained to maximize performance over multiple accuracy measures. To do this, we evaluate several metalearning algorithms on the problem of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. The multiple accuracy measures included mean squared error, correlation, relative squared error, and fraction of satisfactory predictions. The proposed metalearning algorithms have a two-layer architecture, where the first layer consists of multiple neural networks, each trained using a different accuracy measure, and the second layer aggregates decisions of the first layer predictors. To evaluate AOD predictors, we used nearly 70000 collocated data points whose attributes were radiances, solar and view angles, and terrain elevation from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument satellite observations and whose target AOD variable was obtained from the ground-based AEROsol robotic NETwork (AERONET) instruments. The data were collected at 221 AERONET locations over the globe in the period between 2005 and 2007. AOD prediction accuracies of neural networks were compared to the recently developed operational MODIS C005 retrieval algorithm and to several other data-mining methods. Results showed that neural networks are better at reproducing the test data than the operational retrieval algorithm and that predictors obtained by metalearning are robust over multiple accuracy measures. © 2006 IEEE."

E-Water aims at providing optimal management solutions to enhance food crop production at river basin level. The DSS was applied in the transboundary Mékrou river basin, shared among Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The primary sector for local economy in the region is agriculture, contributing significantly to income generation and job creation. Fostering the productivity of regional agricultural requires the intensification of farming practices, promoting additional inputs (mainly nutrient fertilizers and water irrigation) but, also, a more efficient allocation of cropland. In order to cope with the heterogeneity of data, and the analyses and issues required by the WEFE nexus approach, our DSS integrates the following modules: (1) the EPIC biophysical agricultural model; (2) a simplified regression metamodel, linking crop production with external inputs; (3) a linear programming and a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization routines for finding efficient agricultural strategies; and (4) a user-friendly interface for input/output analysis and visualization. To test the main features of the DSS, we apply it to various real and hypothetical scenarios in the Mékrou river basin. The results obtained show how food unavailability due to insufficient local production could be reduced by, approximately, one third by enhancing the application and optimal distribution of fertilizers and irrigation. That would also affect the total income of the farming sector, eventually doubling it in the best case scenario. Furthermore, the combination of optimal agricultural strategies and modified optimal cropland allocation across the basin would bring additional moderate increases in food self-sufficiency, and more substantial gains in the total agricultural income. The proposed software framework proves to be effective, enabling decision makers to identify efficient and site-specific agronomic management strategies for nutrients and water. Such practices would augment crop productivity, which, in turn, would allow to cope with increasing future food demands, and find a balanced use of natural resources, also taking other economic sectors—like livestock, urban or energy—into account."

In this paper, we establish a 14-DOF dynamic model of an autonomous vehicle and use RL to build a decision-making system for autonomous driving based on simulation. The decision-making process of the vehicle is modeled as an MDP, and the performance of the MDP is improved using an approximate RL.

The ease of programmability makes SDN a great platform implementation of various initiatives that involve application deployment, security solutions, and decentralized network management in a multi-tenant data center environment. Although this can introduce many applications in different areas and leads to the high impact on several aspects, security of SDN architecture remains an open question and needs to be revisited based on the new concept of SDN. Current SDN-based attack detection mechanisms have some limitations. In this paper, we investigate two of those limitations: Misbehavior Attack and NewFlow Attack. We propose a secure system that periodically collects network statistics from the forwarding elements and apply Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms. Our framework ensures that the proposed solution makes the SDN architecture more self-adaptive, and intelligent while reacting to network changes."

First, the method calculates possible 3D shapes of the hanging clothes by simulating the clothes deformation. The 3D shape whose appearance gives the best fit with the observed appearance is selected as estimation of the current state. Then, based on the estimated shape, the 3D position and normal direction of the part where the second manipulator should hold are calculated.

Such issues as keeping up with incoming frames from a camera limit the layers of abstraction that can be applied. This results in software that is customized to the domain at hand, that is difficult to port to other applications and that is not particularly robust to changes in the visual environment. In this paper we describe a high level object definition language that removes the domain specific knowledge from the implementation of the object recognition system. The language has features of object-orientation and logic, being more declarative and less imperative.

A promising approach to solve this problem is to create biologically plausible robot controllers that use detailed neuronal networks. However, this approach yields a large gap between the neuronal network and its connection to the robot on the one side and the technical implementation on the other. Existing approaches neglect bridging this gap between disciplines and their focus on different abstractions layers but manually hand-craft the simulations. This makes the tight technical integration cumbersome and error-prone impairing round-Trip validation and academic advancements. Our approach maps the problem to model-driven engineering techniques and defines a domain-specific language (DSL) for integrating biologically plausible Neuronal Networks in robot control algorithms. It provides different levels of abstraction and sets an interface standard for integration. Our approach is implemented in the Neuro-Robotics Platform (NRP) of the Human Brain Project (HBP1). Its practical applicability is validated in a minimalist experiment inspired by the Braitenberg vehicles based on the simulation of a four-wheeled Husky2 robot controlled by a neuronal network."

They are used for example in embedded systems such as UAV, e.g. for video processing. It is a challenge to design Autonomic Managers for such highly dynamic systems, taking into account the combina-torial design space of configurations and criteria and policies to decide on whether to reconfigure, and what next configuration to choose. In this paper, we propose a Domain Specific Language (DSL) called Ctrl-DPR, allowing designers to easily generate Autonomic Managers. They can describe their system and their management strategies, in terms of the entities composing the system: tasks, versions, applications, ressources, policies. The DSL relies on a behavioural modelling of these entities, targeted at the design of autonomic managers to control the reconfigurations in such a way as to enforce given policies and strategies. The models we use involve automata to describe the state space of configurations, and the transitions representing reconfigurations; they also involve discrete control techniques exploiting such models in order to obtain a correct runtime manager. These model-based control techniques are embedded in a compiler, connected to a reactive language and discrete controller synthesis tool, which enables to generate a C implementation of the controller enforcing the management strategies. We apply our DSL for the management of a video application on a UAV."

Game development tools can be of great help, but require highly specialized professionals. Also, just as any software development effort, game development has some challenges. Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is suggested as a means to solve some of these challenges, but witha loss in flexibility. We propose a MDGD approach that combines multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs) with design patterns to provide flexibility and allow generated code to be integrated with manual code. After experimentation, we observed that, with the approach, less experienced developers can create games faster and more easily, and the product of code generation can be customized with manually written code, providing flexibility. However, with MDGD, developers become less familiar with the code, making manual codification more difficult."
A formal approach to adaptive software: continuous assurance of non-functional requirements,"Filieri, Antonio;Ghezzi, Carlo;Tamburrelli, Giordano",Formal Aspects of Computing,2012,WOS,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Formal Aspects of Computing,2012-03-01,10.1007/s00165-011-0207-2,2-s2.0-84861575927,(Self)Adaptive software | Bayesian inference | Markov models | Model-driven development | Models | Monitoring | Non-functional requirements | Performance | Probabilistic model checking | Reliability | Software evolution | Verification,"Modern software systems are increasingly requested to be adaptive to changes in the environment in which they are embedded. Moreover, adaptation often needs to be performed automatically, through self-managed reactions enacted by the application at run time. Off-line, human-driven changes should be requested only if self-adaptation cannot be achieved successfully. To support this kind of autonomic behavior, software systems must be empowered by a rich run-time support that can monitor the relevant phenomena of the surrounding environment to detect changes, analyze the data collected to understand the possible consequences of changes, reason about the ability of the application to continue to provide the required service, and finally react if an adaptation is needed. This paper focuses on non-functional requirements, which constitute an essential component of the quality that modern software systems need to exhibit. Although the proposed approach is quite general, it is mainly exemplified in the paper in the context of service-oriented systems, where the quality of service (QoS) is regulated by contractual obligations between the application provider and its clients.We analyze the case where an application, exported as a service, is built as a composition of other services. Non-functional requirements\- such as reliability and performance\-heavily depend on the environment in which the application is embedded. Thus changes in the environment may ultimately adversely affect QoS satisfaction.We illustrate an approach and support tools that enable a holistic view of the design and run-time management of adaptive software systems. The approach is based on formal (probabilistic) models that are used at design time to reason about dependability of the application in quantitative terms. Models continue to exist at run time to enable continuous verification and detection of changes that require adaptation. © 2011 BCS."

One of the fundamental problems in this context is that of exploration: The robots must coordinate to visit all locations that are reachable from their initial positions. Despite its apparent simplicity, this problem proved quite hard to characterise fully, due to many model variants, leading to informal error-prone reasoning. Over the past few years, a significant effort permitted to set up a formal framework, relying on the Coq proof assistant, which was used to provide certified results when robots evolve in a continuous bi-dimensional Euclidean space. However, the most challenging issues with exploration arise in the discrete setting (a.k.a. graph), where locations are modeled as vertices and where edges between vertices denote the ability for a robot to move from one location to the next. We present a formal model to tackle problems and reason about robot algorithms arising in the discrete setting. Our approach extends and generalises previous research efforts focusing on the continuous model. As case studies, we consider fundamental impossibility results for exploration with stop in the discrete model. To our knowledge, those are the first certified results in this context. This framework paves the way for a general certification workflow dedicated to mobile robots on graphs."

We propose a novel framework for automatic model-driven 2D echocardiography (echo) acquisition for robust respiratory motion estimation. The framework uses a MR-derived respiratory motion model to automatically control the 2D echo acquisition, for example by using a robotic arm. The motion model is also used to estimate the uncertainty associated with respiratory motion variability, which is resolved by using the model-driven 2D echo imaging in the Bayesian estimation technique previously proposed by our group for use with 3D echo [1]. For a thorough accuracy validation of the proposed framework, MR-derived gold standard motion fields and echo images of 4 volunteer datasets are employed. In this work, two clinically relevant 2D echo imaging planes were considered and compared. We show that the Bayesian estimation technique is accurate and robust when using 2D echo images, with improvements in motion estimation for each dataset of 41.5%, 46.5%, 38.1% and 18.9% over the best comparative method. Accuracy improvements due to the model-driven echo acquisition were achieved for each dataset, with improvements of up to 30.5%. © 2013 IEEE."

Over time and with the high penetration of smartphones in society, self-adaptation has become an essential capability required by mobile application users. In an ideal scenario, an application is required to adjust its behavior according to the current context of its use. This raises the challenge in mobile computing towards the design and development of applications that sense and react to contextual changes to provide a value-added user experience. In its general sense, context information can relate to the environment, the user, or the device status. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for building context aware and adaptive mobile applications. Based on feature modeling and Software Product Lines (SPL) concepts, this framework guides the modeling of adaptability at design time and supports context awareness and adaptability at runtime. In the core of the approach, is a feature meta-model that incorporates, in addition to SPL concepts, application feature priorities to drive the adaptability. A tool, based on that feature model, is presented to model the mobile application features and to derive the SPL members. A mobile framework, built on top of OSGI framework to dynamically adapt the application at runtime is also described. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

However, the connection of a robot to spiking neuronal networks needs adjustments for each purpose and requires frequent adaptation during an iterative development. Existing approaches cannot bridge the gap between robotics and neuroscience or do not account for frequent adaptations. The contribution of this paper is an architecture and domain-specific language (DSL) for connecting robots to spiking neuronal networks for iterative testing in simulations, allowing neuroscientists to abstract from implementation details. The framework is implemented in a web-based platform. We validate the applicability of our approach with a case study based on image processing for controlling a four-wheeled robot in an experiment setting inspired by Braitenberg vehicles."

Hence, the framework combines business process management (BPM) concepts and Web services technology. To build B2B collaborations both organizations have to provide public parts of their process models as basis for discussion for collaborative process modelling. The internal private processes are generated from collaborative process, based on model-driven approach (MDA). At the execution level, B2B interactions are modeled based on Web services. Finally, we validate our proposition with the implementation of an e-ordering system."

It will also be shown that it can be used to easier resolve composition issues when creating a system by means of component-composition. This framework helps creating statechart based components that reside in the middle ground between a blackbox component and an statechart interpreter. In addition to supporting a Model Driven development style, the framework creates a reflective architecture of the component without any involvement from the developer. This reflectiveness adds the ability to modify the component's statechart model at run-time and can be used as a basis for a self healing mechanism. © 2008 IEEE."

In addition, these security measures cannot be automatically represented at logical level, so heuristic design guides for such transformations have appeared.

Making a right decision, when facing today's sophisticated and dynamic attacks, is one of the most challenging aspects of engineering self-protecting software systems. Inspired by game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the software system as a two-player game. Using game-theoretic techniques, the self-protecting software systems is able to: (i) fuse the strategies of attackers into the decision-making model, and (ii) refine the strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's interactions. This research introduces a novel decision-making framework with three phases: (i) modeling quality goals aiming at incorporating them into the decision model, (ii) designing game-theoretic techniques in order to build the decision model, and (iii) realizing the decisionmaking engine in the adaptation manager. Modeling quality goals provides the adaptation manager with the knowledgebase required in making a systematic adaptation decision. The framework aims at exhibiting a plug-and-play capability to adapt game-theoretic techniques that suite security goals and requirements of the software."

To harvest the full potential of robots, it must be possible to define missions for robots that are domain-specific, resilient, and collaborative. Currently, robot vendors provide low-level APIs to program such missions, making mission definition a task-specific and error-prone activity. There is a need for quick definition of new missions, by users that lack programming expertise, such as farmers and emergency workers. In this paper, we extend the existing FLYAQ platform to support the high-level specification of adaptive and highly-resilient missions. We present an extensible specification language that allows users to declaratively specify domain-specific constraints as properties of missions, thus complementing the existing FLYAQ mission language. This permits to move at runtime, the actual generation of low-level operations to satisfy the declaratively specified mission. We show how this specification language can be automatically generated from a domain-specific FLYAQ mission language by using the generative ProMoBox approach. Next, we show how mission goals are achieved taking mission properties into account, and how missions may change due to unexpected circumstances."

This can lead to an erroneous shape description, particularly where there are significantly sharp changes in shape, such as at sharp corners. This paper presents a novel shape description algorithm called a generic shape descriptor using Bezier curves (SDBC) which defines a new strategy for Bezier control point generation by integrating domain specific information about the shape of an object in a particular region. The strategy also includes an improved dynamic fixed length coding scheme for control points.

While each study area introduces a different perspective, they share the need to integrate positioning data with domain-specific information. Semantic annotations are necessary to improve discovery, reuse, and integration of trajectory data from different sources. Consequently, it would be beneficial if the common structure encountered in trajectory data could be annotated based on a shared vocabulary, abstracting from domain-specific aspects. Ontology design patterns are an increasingly popular approach to define such flexible and self-contained building blocks of annotations. They appear more suitable for the annotation of interdisciplinary, multi-thematic, and multi-perspective data than the use of foundational and domain ontologies alone. In this paper, we introduce such an ontology design pattern for semantic trajectories. It was developed as a community effort across multiple disciplines and in a data-driven fashion.

Later decisions to be made concerning appropriate operations that have to be undertaken are more difficult when the system architect starts facing design problems.

Such systems demand high processing performance and accurate depth perception while requiring low energy consumption, especially when dealing with mobile and embedded applications, such as robotics, navigation, and security. The majority of real-time dedicated hardware implementations of disparity estimation systems have adopted local algorithms relying on simple cost aggregation strategies with fixed and rectangular correlation windows. However, such algorithms generally suffer from significant ambiguity along depth borders and areas with low texture. To this end, this article presents the hardware architecture of a disparity estimation system that enables good performance in both accuracy and speed. The architecture implements an adaptive support weight stereo correspondence algorithm that integrates image segmentation information in an attempt to increase the robustness of the matching process. The article also presents hardware-oriented algorithmic modifications/optimization techniques that make the algorithm hardware-friendly and suitable for efficient dedicated hardware implementation. A comparison to the literature asserts that an FPGA implementation of the proposed architecture is among the fastest implementations in terms of million disparity estimations per second (MDE/s), and with an overall accuracy of 90.21%, it presents an effective processing speed/disparity map accuracy trade-off."

One powerful algorithm in this field uses HOG features to describe the specific properties of pedestrians in images. To determine their locations, features are extracted and classified window-wise from different scales of an input image. The results of the classification are finally merged to remove overlapping detections. The real-time execution of this method requires specific FPGA- or ASIC-architectures. Recent work focused on accelerating the feature extraction and classification. Although merging is an important step in the algorithm, it is only rarely considered in hardware implementations. A reason for that could be its complexity and irregularity that is not trivial to implement in hardware. In this paper, we present a new bottom-up FPGA architecture that maps the full HOG-based algorithm for pedestrian detection including feature extraction, SVM classification, and multi-scale processing in combination with merging. For that purpose, we also propose a new hardware-optimized merging method. The resulting architecture is highly efficient. Additionally, we present an FPGA-based full real-time and multi-scale pedestrian detection demonstration system."

The PKM is formed by the payload and groups of robots rigidly attached to the payload, which can be regarded as virtual legs. Using the PKM, we present a hybrid coordination framework with a hierarchical structure, based on a centralized inter-group manipulation at top level and a distributed intra-group manipulation at lower level. The former solves the direct kinematics of the PKM in a centralized manner and the latter consists of a distributed formation control within a virtual leg.

Species in the Digital Ecosystem can play dual roles, which are service requester (client) service provider (server). A service provider enters the Digital Ecosystem by publishing a service metadata in the service factory, in which the service metadata can be clustered by domain-specific ontologies provided by the Digital Ecosystem. Two issues emerge here. First of all, vast and heterogeneous service metadata are ubiquitous before the Digital Ecosystem technology emerges. It is a challenge for the Digital Ecosystem to organize these metadata. In order to solve this issue, an automatic service metadata clustering approach could be desired. However, this could educe the second issue - the automatic association between service concepts and service metadata could not agree with service providers' perceptions, as a result of the differences among individual understandings. To solve the two issues, in this paper, we present a hybrid ontology-based metadata clustering methodology comprising an extended case-based reasoning algorithm-based automatic concept-metadata association approach and a service provideroriented concept-metadata association approach. © 2009 IEEE."

SDPs provide a horizontal layer above the operators' service network for creation, deployment, execution, monitoring of services and management of service providers. Predominantly, in current SDP solutions, service oriented architecture (SOA) is employed in the core and in the services layer. This architecture provides service flexibility and business agility while decreasing the performance of service execution. On the other hand, native-coded applications are obviously better in terms of execution performance but they mostly lack flexibility and business agility. In this paper, an agile SDP based on a hybrid MDA-SOA approach is proposed to benefit both from the flexibility of SOA and from the performance of native-coded applications by automatically converting BPEL-defined processes to self executable services. © 2008 by Boǧaziçi University."

Many WSN applications often need to know the sensor position and the global time to report a given event detection with a specific location and time. However, such services are performed after the sensors deployment in the sensed field. In this case, setting up each sensor manually becomes an impractical activity, requiring some system that automatically locates and synchronizes the sensor nodes. For this purpose, we developed a joint solution to 3D localization and clock synchronization problems using a hybrid approach, which combines mobile and recursive localization. In our work, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a GPS is used to fly over the sensor field and broadcast its geographical position and timestamp. Using the messages received from the UAV, the sensor nodes are able to estimate their geographic positions and synchronize their clocks. When a node is located in time and space, it transmits its own position and timestamp to the neighbor nodes. The neighbors use the received information to locate themselves so that this iterative process is propagated throughout the network. Simulations results showed that the proposed solution presents low clock synchronization and positioning errors. In our solution, the cost of the network is also reduced because only one GPS receiver is used for the entire sensor field."

One of the most demanded topics in this area is related to the automated planning of a UAVs swarm, controlled by one or several Ground Control Stations (GCSs). In this context, there are several variables that influence the selection of the most appropriate plan, such as the makespan, the cost or the risk of the mission. This problem can be seen as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOP). On previous approaches, the problem was modelled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and solved using a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), so a Pareto Optimal Frontier (POF) was obtained. The main problem with this approach is based on the large number of obtained solutions, which hinders the selection of the best solution. This paper presents a new algorithm that has been designed to obtain the most significant solutions in the POF. This approach is based on Knee Points applied to MOGA. The new algorithm has been proved in a real scenario with different number of optimization variables, the experimental results show a significant improvement of the algorithm performance."

To gather the necessary knowledge for smart functionalities both cyber and physical parts must be captured, kept and analyzed together in a suitable CPS architecture – also despite frequent evolutionary changes during their whole (usually relative long) life span.

However, creating large 3D LiDAR point cloud datasets with point-level labels requires a significant amount of manual annotation. This jeopardizes the efficient development of supervised deep learning algorithms which are often data-hungry. We present a framework to rapidly create point clouds with accurate point-level labels from a computer game. To our best knowledge, this is the first publication on LiDAR point cloud simulation framework for autonomous driving. The framework supports data collection from both auto-driving scenes and user-configured scenes. Point clouds from auto-driving scenes can be used as training data for deep learning algorithms, while point clouds from user-configured scenes can be used to systematically test the vulnerability of a neural network, and use the falsifying examples to make the neural network more robust through retraining. In addition, the scene images can be captured simultaneously in order for sensor fusion tasks, with a method proposed to do automatic registration between the point clouds and captured scene images. We show a significant improvement in accuracy (+9%) in point cloud segmentation by augmenting the training dataset with the generated synthesized data. Our experiments also show by testing and retraining the network using point clouds from user-configured scenes, the weakness/blind spots of the neural network can be fixed."

Furthermore, realistic problems often require complex objective functions that complicate problem decomposition. In this paper, we propose a local search approach to plan the trajectories of a fleet of UAVs on an observation mission. The strength of the approach lies in its loose coupling with domain specific requirements such as the UAV model or the objective function that are both used as black boxes. Furthermore, the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) procedure considered facilitates adaptation of the algorithm to specific requirements through the addition of new neighborhoods. We demonstrate the feasibility and convenience of the method on a large joint observation task in which a fleet of fixed-wing UAVs maps wildfires over areas of a hundred square kilometers. The approach allows generating plans over tens of minutes for a handful of UAVs in matter of seconds, even when considering very short primitive maneuvers."

However, the disadvantage of its own large model makes it difficult to apply on resource-constrained devices such as mobile devices. In order to solve this problem, the existing research and technology mainly focus on the DNN model compression and the segmentation migration of the model. The former is generally at the expense of reducing accuracy, and the segmentation of the model has no unified migration tool for the DNN model of different applications. In this work, we propose a universal neural network layer segmentation tool, which enables the trained DNN model to be migrated, and migrates the segmentation layer to the nodes in the current network in accordance with the dynamic optimal allocation algorithm proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the tool can adapt to various neural networks with different structures and perform optimal allocation of layers through algorithm. When the number of working nodes increases from 1 to 5, this method can speed up DNN 2-2.5 times, and shows a good acceleration effect."

When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same spatial area simultaneously, they might collide with one another, might become deadlocked, or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle. In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes with different priorities meet. We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points, where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems for cooperating with other self-driving and/or human-driven vehicles.

However, agent-oriented software engineering has not been widely adopted, mainly due to lack of modeling languages that are expressive and comprehensive enough to represent relevant agent-related abstractions and support the refinement of design models into code. Most modeling languages do not define how these abstractions interact at runtime, but many software applications need to adapt their behavior, react to changes in their environments dynamically, and align with some form of individual or collective normative application behavior (e.g., obligations, prohibitions). In this paper, we propose a metamodel approach to developing adaptive normative agents. We believe the proposed approach will advance the state of the art in agent systems so that software technologies for dynamic, adaptive, norm-based applications can be developed and implemented."

This paper presents a methodological approach to the design and development of complex automation systems relying on model-driven engineering (MDE). A benefit of this approach is the integration of methods and techniques widespread within the automation discipline with modern MDE techniques guiding the designer through the development phases. A second advantage is to add flexibility enough to adapt the steps to the needs of the system under design. Finally, the architecture presented is prepared to be adapted to methodology extensions to cover other aspects of automation systems. The framework is based on domain models that are defined through the development phases using the terminology of the automation field. Using model transformations both documentation about system analysis and design and the skeleton of software units are automatically generated. A proof-of-concept tool has been developed that has been tested on the design of medium-complexity projects to assess the impact of its use with respect to project documentation and maintenance.Note to Practitioners - Control software development can be considered one of the challenges in automation field for achieving leadership in the future economic market. This work presents a model-driven engineering-based approach making use of both automation and software engineering methods and techniques for developing automation control systems. The framework implements the methodology for industrial automation systems (MeiA•) for guiding developers through the development phases and generates the analysis and design documentation using domain terminology, the design documentation that involves the minimal units of design, and the program organization units in one-to-one correspondence with the minimal units of design. From a practical point of view, it should be highly emphasized that developers of automation projects benefit from more structured designs, reduced number of errors, and improved project documentation."

Most existing solutions solve these issues by manually modelling the robotic hand [10-18]. However, the design processes are long, and it is difficult to duplicate the geometry shape of a human hand. To solve these two issues, this paper presents a simple and effective method that combines 3D printing and digitization techniques to create a 3D printable cable-driven robotic hand from scanning a physical hand. The method involves segmenting the 3D scanned hand model, adding joints, and converting it into a 3D printable model. Comparing to other robotic solutions, our solution retains more than 90% geometry information of a human hand1, which is attained from 3D scanning. Our modelling progress takes around 15 minutes that include 10 minutes of 3D scanning and five minutes for changing the scanned model to an articulated model by running our algorithm. Compared to other articulated modelling solutions [19, 20], our solution is compatible with an actuation system which provides our robotic hand with the ability to mimic different gestures. We have also developed a way of representing hand skeletons based on the hand anthropometric. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate our robotic hand's performance in the grasping experiments."

Much work has focused on instantiating learning or evolution in robots, but relatively little on development. Although many theories have been forwarded as to how development can aid evolution, it is difficult to isolate each such proposed mechanism. Thus, here we introduce a minimal yet embodied model of development: the body of the robot changes over its lifetime, yet growth is not influenced by the environment. We show that even this simple developmental model confers evolvability because it allows evolution to sweep over a larger range of body plans than an equivalent non-developmental system, and subsequent heterochronic mutations 'lock in' this body plan in more morphologically-static descendants. Future work will involve gradually complexifying the developmental model to determine when and how such added complexity increases evolvability."

The proposed algorithm makes it possible to overcome the assumptions commonly used in most of the detection systems using monocular vision such as: flat road, constant pitch angle or absence of roll angle. The proposed method of detection and 3D reconstruction is based on two modules. The first one is aimed at detecting the road markings of the lane in each image of the stereoscopic pair. It is based on a recognition algorithm driven by a statistical model of the road lane: the initial state of the model is obtained after a learning stage ; it is updated using the results of a feature extraction stage. Our model takes into account the intrinsic links between the projections of the road in the two images of the stereoscopic pair, so that its update from a feature extracted in one of two images drives the detection of the features in the other image. No disparity map is required since the matching of the road features is directly obtained as the result of the model update. The second module is aimed at 3D reconstruction and relative localization of the vehicle with respect to its lane. The parameters of a 3D surface including the horizontal and vertical profiles of the road lane are estimated from the road borders previously detected. The robustness of the algorithm is evaluated from synthetic and real images. © 2008 IEEE."

To avoid these errors or faults, Fault Tolerant (FT) systems are evolved. But still, some more hidden design faults are not weeded out before realization by traditional and life cycle tests and analysis. In this paper, an approach has been described to find out these types of faults by simulating system architecture with modeling and simulation. By this model based methods, one can enable early verification of the system and quickly find errors or faults and deal with it. This is a very attractive approach, since the systems are critical systems, in which a pre condition that applies to those systems to evaluate or analyze. By doing so, one can test and analyze their system even before hardware as well as software realization [1]. Also, nowadays, the cost of developing a critical system increases exponentially when system design errors are found after the implementation or integration of the system.

From a modeling point of view, the aim should be to help in the design by providing adequate tools that assist in the development of important properties of AmI systems, such as context-awareness; and from an implementation point of view, agent technologies must be adapted to the diversity of AmI devices and communication technologies. As a solution to these issues we propose a Model driven engineering process, which supports the automatic generation of agent-based AmI systems. The source metamodel is PIM4Agents, a general purpose agent metamodel that we have adapted to support the explicit modeling of context aware systems, and the target metamodel is Malaca, an aspect-oriented agent architecture. Aspect-orientation makes Malaca platform-neutral for FIPA compliant agent platforms, simplifying the model driven process. The solution generates MalacaTiny agents, an implementation of Malaca that is able to run in AmI devices. We have evaluated the convenience of applying a model driven approach by measuring the degree of automation of our process and we have evaluated MalacaTiny for mobile phones by assessing different parameters, related to the scarcity of resources in AmI systems. All the results obtained are satisfactory. © 2013 The Author(s)."

Traditional human-in-the-loop service engineering approach met its insurmountable challenge in dealing with these very complex and diverse networked systems, including conventional and software defined networks, compute, storage, clouds and instruments. Orchestration is the key to integrate and coordinate the networked multi-services and automate end-to-end workflows. In this work, we present a model driven intelligent orchestration approach to this end-to-end automation, which is built upon a semantic modeling solution that supports the full stack of service integration, orchestration, abstraction, and intent and policy representation. We also present the design of a real-world orchestrator called StackV that is able to accommodate highly complex application scenarios such as Software Defined ScienceDMZ (SD-SDMZ) and Hybrid Cloud Inter-Networking (HCIN) by implementing this approach."

Typically network information such as physical, logical inventory, alarms and the like are persisted on the management station's database. The management station also routinely accesses the devices for faults and configurations. Due to the diverse nature of the network, applications need to understand the different management protocols and associated device intricacies to interact with the device. Similarly applications are exposed to the underlying data model and database access mechanisms. This makes the applications hard to evolve and cumbersome to maintain as any changes in the underlying mechanisms warrants a change in the application. Thus there is a need for a uniform model and a component based on it for device as well as database access, which abstracts the underlying details so that applications can focus on providing valuable services. The objective of this paper is to highlight the need for a uniform model and propose a metadata driven approach for device and database access components. © 2006 IEEE."

To address this problem, we present a model predictive-based approach for longitudinal control in autonomous driving by taking the lateral interruptions into account. First, a virtual lead vehicle scheme is introduced to predict the future behavior of the actual lead vehicle. By following the virtual lead vehicle rather than the actual lead vehicle, the control of the host vehicle is simplified to keep a proper following gap problem. Then, a strategic car-following gap (CFG) model, generated from highway naturalistic driving data, is employed to describe the safety hazard and the probability of cut-ins by other vehicles. A model predictive controller, incorporating the strategic CFG model as well as the acceleration and jerk limitations in the objective function, is designed for the longitudinal control of the host vehicle. Solving the optimal control problem can not only smooth the oscillation and overshoots caused by the lateral interruptions but also reduce the probability of cut-ins from the adjacent lanes. The proposed approach is simulated and validated through some predefined test scenarios in CarSim software."

Therefore, debugging usually requires to instrument the code so as to produce execution traces that are then monitored from a base station. Such an intrusive method has a direct impact on performances. In case of multiple interacting embedded targets the problem is even more severe and is not limited to computations but also spreads to communications. To reduce the communication overhead, we propose an approach in which unsynchronized traces from several targets are reconciled a posteriori. Since each target has its own time base without a built-in clock synchronization protocol, our approach requires a multi-clock reconciliation specification. This paper describes our model-based proposal developed during the ANR project RT-Simex. The different steps of the reconciliation are illustrated on a simple case-study used in the project, a terrestrial robot controlled in position. © 2011 IEEE."

We argue that software deployment decisions should be separated as much as possible from the core development of software functionalities. This will make the developed software more independent of a particular hardware architecture (and thus more reusable) and allow it to be deployed more flexibly on a wider variety of robot platforms.

Based on computed tomography data of a patients head, our approach aims to extract the border that separates the structures of interest from the rest of the head. This three-dimensional region information is useful in many clinical applications, e.g. diagnosis, surgical simulation, surgical planning and robot assisted surgery. The desired boundary can be made up of bone, mucosa or air what makes the segmentation process very difficult and brings traditional segmentation approaches, like e.g. region growing, to their limits. Motivated by the work of Tsai et al. [1] and Leventon et al. [2], we therefore show how a parametric level-set model can be generated from hand-segmented nasal cavity and paranasal sinus data that gives us the ability to transform the complex segmentation problem into a finite-dimensional one. On this basis, we propose a processing chain for the automated segmentation of the endonasal structures that incorporates the model information and operates without any user interaction. Promising results are obtained by evaluating our approach on two-dimensional data slices of 50 patients with very diverse paranasal sinuses. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

In Multi-Agent Systems, interaction protocols were invented for this purpose. Simple UML-like diagrams have been used, focusing mostly in the specification of the sequence in which messages can be exchanged and who they can be sent to. Relevant details have been left out, making these models easy to understand for the reader, but at the same time less flexible, reusable, machine readable and hard to use for automatic development where more insights on the semantics of the model are necessary. We propose a declarative and more expressive model which makes use of well known contributions of the area of Multi-Agents. Adding more details inevitably increases complexity and to deal with it, we propose a model-driven tool. The tool is composed two parts, one is a graphical editor, which visualizes the semantics and effects of the definitions made by the designer, in real time and using planing algorithms. The other is an automatic code generator that produces Jadex BDI agents.

The algorithm is implemented in order to validate the method in a real-time context. Results obtained on marked and unmarked road images show the robustness and precision of the method."

Specifically, it shows the Model-Driven Development (MDD) of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) targeted to the achievement of the so called 'Spacecraft on-board software flexibility'. In fact, the goal of the presented work has been to deploy a full-featured IDE to be used for the development of the 'On-board Command Procedures' (OBCPs). The OBCPs coding is done by using the 'OBCP Definition Language' (ODL), specified by Thales Alenia Space Italy (TASI) on the basis of the requirements stated in the 'Space Engineering: Spacecraft On-board Control Procedures' ECSS standard (ECSS-E-ST-70-01, 16 April 2010). This standard does not impose specific language syntax but provides the guidelines for its specification. By following such guidelines and by exploiting some MDE technologies and tools, such as Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Xtext, it has been possible to realize an Eclipse-based IDE able to provide to the ODL developer the entire features essential in a modern environment for software development. The considered features include the 'traditional' ones as syntax-highlighting, code-completion, version-control, on-line error-checking, and also 'advanced' ones like syntactic validation, semantic validation, and integrated code compilation. Moreover, by means of the adopted MDE approach, a very large part of the IDE code has been automatically generated starting from the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) specification of the ODL grammar so allowing for the IDE developers to be more focused on validation issues and on the quality of product than on the coding activity. All this has been obtained by following the paradigm 'coding equals modeling', for which each program represents a behavioral model compliant to the meta-model specified by the grammar of the language itself. The obtained result is a professional product that satisfies all the expected requirements, but this would be just a starting point since the ultimate goal of this work is to contribute to fostering the adoption of MDE approaches in the spacecraft software domain."

The simulation environments for such a paradigm, therefore, need to take into account the cooperation between design teams, i.e. supporting multidisciplinary simulation in a distributed environment. However, current simulation tools can not fulfil this requirement as they have been developed to solve the specific problems from different disciplines. Although it's already possible to perform multidisciplinary simulations by using several tools together, it is very difficult to implement it when these tools are distributed on the Internet. A solution which can support the integration of distributed simulation models at run-time is presented, involving a computational infrastructure and a high-level modelling approach. Specifically, the infrastructure is constructed by a novel combination of two distributed computing techniques to implement the synchronization of distributed models, as well as to ensure the interoperability at run-time. In addition, a model-driven approach is developed to bridge the high-level model of a simulation system and the infrastructure which implements this model. The solution is evaluated by making a comparison with other approaches, as well as by developing a prototype tool.

However, software development in the context of industrial robotics is dominated by practices that require attention to low-level accidental complexities related to the solution space of a particular domain. Most vendor-specific robotics platforms force the developer to be concerned with many low-level implementation details, which presents a maintenance challenge in the context of making engineering changes to the robotics solution. Additionally, satisfying the timing requirements across the platforms of multiple robot vendors represents an additional challenge. We introduce our work using Domain-Specific Modeling to support the control of industrial robots using models that are at a higher level of abstraction than traditional robot programming languages. Our modeling approach assists robotics developers to plan the schedule, validate timing requirements, optimize robot control, handle engineering changes, and support multiple platforms. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

Using two major abstract concepts, services and connections between services, each grid application is designed as a collection of loosely-coupled services in an implementation independent manner. In service-oriented grids, the non-functional aspects of services and connections (e.g., message transmission and security) should be described separately from their functional aspects because different applications use services and connections in different nonfunctional requirements. This paper presents a UML profile to graphically specify and maintain non-functional aspects in service-oriented grids as implementation independent UML models.

In this context, innovative approaches should be introduced at design time to ensure that the system will achieve the mission objectives at operation time. To this purpose, distributed simulation techniques have shown to be effective to deal with the inherent complexity of the environment to be simulated, which generally includes several interacting entities. Unfortunately, currently available distributed simulation standards, such as HLA (High Level Architecture), require a non-negligible effort and significant skills in terms of both simulation methodologies and related implementation technologies. In this respect, this paper focuses on the simulationbased analysis of systems with autonomous capabilities and introduces a model-driven approach to support the automated generation of HLA-based distributed simulations. The proposed approach is founded on the use of model transformation techniques and allows system designers to carry out a timely and cost-effective simulation-based analysis of the operational system without being required to own specific distributed simulation skills."

To that end, many service providers have adopted the shared service model where the service offerings are shared across multiple customers to reduce the costs associated with the services' delivery. One key challenge for service providers is how to configure various parameters and options of the services with highly automated and self-service modes to meet the customers' diverse requirements with minimized costs. Therefore, effective service configuration lifecycle management technologies and approaches have become the differentiations of successful service providers. In this paper, we propose a common service configuration framework as one of the infrastructure features of the service operation platform based on the shared service model to ease and unify the configuration lifecycle across service offerings. In this framework, we adopt the model-driven technology to automate the service configuration lifecycle. This novel approach combines the wizard technology and rule-based validation technology to enable the service customers to perform self-service configuration. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework is discussed at the end of this paper. © 2008 IEEE."

We suppose a system consisting of two manipulators and a camera. The task considered in this paper is to hold a pullover at its two shoulders by two manipulators respectively, as a first step for folding it. The proposed method estimates the state of the clothes held by one manipulator in a model-driven way and indicates the position to be held next by the other manipulator. First, the possible appearances of the pullover when it is held at one point are roughly predicted. Using discriminative features of the predicted appearances, the possible states for the observed appearance are selected. Each appearance of the possible state is partially deformed so as to get close to the observed appearance. The state whose appearance successfully approaches closest to the observed appearance is selected as the final decision. The point to be held next is determined according to the state. The results of preliminary experiments using actual images have shown the good potential of the proposed method."

This process is an integration of a popular agile software development process, Scrum, with the concept of UML as a blueprint or executable for. The mScrum4SOSR is applied to three development teams: a reverse engineering team and two forward engineering teams for service consumption and production. To comprehend internal operations of a legacy system, the reverse engineering team represents a high level abstraction of the system in visual models. Scrum is conducted to generate a sharable visual model at this reverse engineering phase. The model is subdivided into two models for service consumer and producer by identifying candidate services from the model of the legacy system. With the models and the product backlog, two Sprints for service consumer and producer start at the next forward software engineering phase in parallel. The development team of each Sprint shares the changes of the models and the Scrum Master maintains the synchronized version of the model for partially shippable target system during a Sprint. The process brings two main benefits to the SOSR teams: 1) we can seamlessly use an agile process, Scrum, for a reverse engineering team and two forward software engineering teams. And 2) the model-driven process complements the project management process Scrum by injecting one of the best software development practices, elevating the level of abstraction, into Scrum. © 2009 IEEE."

Most of them take into account user preferences, their habits and are able to notify travellers with real time traffic information, delays, schedules update, etc.. To make urban mobility more sustainable, the journey planners of the future must include: (1) techniques to generate journey alternatives that take into account not only user preferences and needs but also specific city challenges and local mobility operators resources; (2) agile development approaches to make the update of the models and information used by the journey planners a self-adaptive task; (3) techniques for the continuous journeys monitoring able to understand when a current journey is no longer valid and to propose alternatives. In this paper we present the experiences matured during the development of a complete solution for mobility planning based on model-driven engineering techniques. Mobility challenges, resources and remarks are modelled by corresponding languages, which in turn support the automated derivation of a smart journey planner. By means of the introduced automation, it has been possible to reduce the complexity of encoding journey planning policies and to make journey planners more flexible and responsive with respect to adaptation needs."

However, the internal processes and interfaces of the participating partners are often pre-existing and have to be taken as given. Furthermore, in cross-organisational scenarios partners are typically very sensitive about their product data and the algorithms that process it. In many cases, private processes are only partially visible and hidden behind public interface descriptions. This imposes restrictions on the possible solutions for the problems which occur when partner processes are integrated. In this paper, we describe a solution which supports rapid prototyping by combining a model-driven framework for cross-organisational business processes with an agent-based approach for flexible process execution. We show how the model-driven approach can be combined with semantic service discovery for flexible service composition.Copyright © 2008, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagents Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

This work presents models of four-wheel drive and steer (4WD4S) robotic systems with all-wheel active drive and steer simultaneously. This kinematic model comprises 12 degrees of freedom (DOFs) in a special design of a mechanical structure for each wheel. The control variables are wheel yaw, wheel roll, and suspension pitch by active/passive damper systems. The pitch angle implies that a wheel's contact point translates its position over time collinear with the robot's lateral sides. The formulation proposed involves the inference of the virtual z-turn axis (robot's body rotation axis) to be used in the control of the robot's posture by at least two acceleration measurements local to the robot's body. The z-turn axis is deduced through a set of linear equations in which the number of equations is equal to the number of acceleration measurements. This research provides two main models for stability conditions. Finally, the results are sustained by different numerical simulations that validate the system with different locomotion configurations."

Therefore, the planner has to identify the UAV trajectories that minimize the Expected Time of Target Detection (ETTD) and nullify the total of NFZ overflights and of UAV collisions. To achieve it, the planner is backed by an ACOr that 1) ensures the feasibility of the trajectories by encoding them as a sequence of input UAV control commands and by decoding them through complex UAVs kinematic/dynamic models, 2) handles the uncertainty of the sensor and of the target location in the computation of the ETTD using Bayesian theory, and 3) improves the planning process with a heuristic that has been especially designed to exploit the probability and spatial properties of the problem. All these properties let our ACOr based planner handle successfully minimum time target detection missions in real world scenarios, as the results analyzed in this paper, obtained over different setups, show."

The supremacy of code over diagrams would be leveled if diagrams were code. This paper suggests that model and instance diagrams, or, which amounts to the same, class and object diagrams, become first level entities in a suitably expressive programming language, viz., type theory. The proposed semantics of diagrams is compositional and self-describing, i.e., reflexive, or metacircular. Moreover, it is well suited for metamodelling and model driven engineering, as it is possible to prove model transformations correct in type theory. The encoding into type theory has the additional benefit of making diagrams immediately useful, given an implementation of type theory."

Due to the nature of harsh and unattended environments, it is impossible to install sensor nodes manually. Therefore, a random deployment fashion such as by aircraft is required. However, with high probability, sensor nodes will not have uniform distribution in the environment which will cause 'hole' in the network. In another issue, sensor nodes are limited in energy supply and transmission range, and thus an appropriate technique is essential to calculate energy efficient routes to relay data from the sensor nodes to the base station. In hierarchical routing category, clustering techniques attempt to partition the sensor nodes in the network to appropriate groups and select the cluster heads to contact with the base station directly. However, in large scale WSNs, most of the sensor nodes are far from the base station and cannot contact directly. Most of the clustering techniques do not consider how cluster heads can reach to the base station. In our research, A Delaunay triangulation approach is employed to detect holes in the network. Then, due to the overhead of clustering methods to define cluster areas, a virtual gridding scheme is applied to define cluster areas. To overcome uncertainties in the environment, a fuzzy logic-based approach is designed to select appropriate cluster heads and hop-nodes in a distributed manner. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed model and applicability to large scale WSNs."
A new sensorless speed estimation strategy for induction motor driven electric vehicle with energy optimization scheme,"Pal, Abhisek;Das, Sukanta","2016 IEEE 1st International Conference on Power Electronics, Intelligent Control and Energy Systems (ICPEICES)",2016,IEEE,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,"1st IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Intelligent Control and Energy Systems, ICPEICES 2016",2017-02-13,10.1109/ICPEICES.2016.7853077,2-s2.0-85015886376,Electric Vehicles | Estimation | Induction Motor | MRAS | Optimization | Sensorless Drives | Speed | Stability,"© 2016 IEEE.This paper aims to propose a new sensorless speed control technique for induction motor (IM) drive suitable for electric vehicle applications using model reference adaptive system (MRAS) with a basic energy optimization scheme known as golden section method. The proposed MRAS is developed by using instantaneous and steady state values of a fictitious resistance (R) in the reference and adaptive models respectively. The optimization scheme generates the optimal level of rotor flux for machine operation and improves the efficiency of the drive system by bringing down the IM core loss. The developed overall scheme is immune to the stator resistance variation. Moreover, the unique formation of the MRAS eliminates completely the requirement of any flux estimation. Thus, the method is insensitive to the integrator-related problems like drift and saturation enabling an accurate estimation of speed even from zero to the rated speed. In this context, all the relevant studies are done in MATLAB/Simulink. A few experimental results are also presented to validate the simulation results."

The language offers three different level of abstraction for robot programming. On lowest level skills are coded by domain experts. On a more abstract level these skills are supposed to be combined by shop floor workers or technicians to define tasks. The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore. To this end we are able to generate code while hiding controller specific implementation details. In addition the development in LightRocks is supported by a generic graphical editor implemented as an Eclipse plugin. © 2013 IEEE."

To do so, they include a technical pervasive infrastructure, which is aware of and adaptive to both the operational context and the users at hand. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) have been effectively used to inform decision-making in software engineering: functional alternatives are compared in terms of their contribution to NFRs satisfaction. In this work, we consider user preferences over NFRs as a key driver for the adaptation of a pervasive infrastructure. We devise a model-driven framework for building pervasive systems that maximize fitness with the context and the user. Our contributions are: (i) adaptive task models, a conceptual model to describe user routines that accounts for user preferences over NFRs; and (ii) an adaptation framework, which uses our models at runtime to guide a pervasive infrastructure in adapting its behaviour to user preferences and context. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

Now a day, gestures are considered to be the most effective communicative medium for remotely controlling a robot. In this work, the gestures are employed to instruct a Khepera II robot to move from a specific starting position to a goal position following a specific path. The main highlight is the determination of exact degree of rotation with proper application of acceleration and brake in order to reach the specified goal position without hitting the obstacles. A Takagi-Sugeno-Kang based fuzzy model with two antecedents (type-2 fuzzy sets) and one consequent (crisp value) has been employed to determine the angle of rotation. The performance of the proposed framework has been tested in terms of a number of parameters like accuracy, precision, error rate etc. And in each case, the formulated strategy has proved its worth."

To estimate accurate camera's gesture as well as road parameters, model-driven approach was introduced in our approach, which was the most popular way for lane detection so far. Be different from traditional processing way relying on visual recognition results, our approach develops a fusion method that was required for more reliable results under various environment conditions. Two processing engines are contained in our system. [1] Visual processing focuses on road segment detection on image. It is called near zone, in which road shape seems as linear and lane feature is easy to be extracted. Parameters: such as road width, vehicle lateral displacement, camera's inclination angle and heading angle, are estimated in this area. [2] Since visual sensor is hard to locate road lane in far zone, which may introduce uncertain noise, vehicle localization with digital map is proposed to assist lane detection for restricting detection zone, where lane might be not seen clearly or block by other objects. Because parameter vector is predicted by our approach and its variance is limited in the rational range, model updating and parameters tracking will be more efficient and reliable by EKF in the fusion step. © 2011 IEEE."

The PENm is modified based on the current EMG-driven models by decreasing the calculation time and ensuring good prediction accuracy. To ensure the calculation efficiency, the PENm is simplified into two EMG channels around one joint with minimal physiological parameters. In addition, a dynamic computation model is developed to achieve real-time calculation. To ensure the calculation accuracy, patient-specific muscle kinematics information, such as the musculotendon lengths and the muscle moment arms during the entire gait cycle, are employed based on the patient-specific musculoskeletal model. Moreover, an improved force-length-velocity relationship is implemented to generate accurate muscle forces. Gait analysis data including kinematics, ground reaction forces, and raw EMG signals from six adolescents at three different speeds were used to evaluate the PENm. The simulation results show that the PENm has the potential to predict accurate joint moment in real-time. The design of advanced human-robot interaction control strategies and human-inspired gait rehabilitation robots can benefit from the application of the human internal state provided by the PENm."

Ultimately, the cable creep can be represented by payloads and cable length estimated according to the changes of actual payloads and cable lengths in static condition."

The models at runtime approach eases the management of such architectures by maintaining abstract models of architectures synchronized with the physical, distributed execution platform. For self-adapting systems, prediction of delays and throughput of a component assembly is of utmost importance to take adaptation decision and accept evolutions that conform to time specifications. To this aim we define a metamodel extension based on stochastic Petri nets as an internal time model for prediction. We design a library of patterns to ease the specification and prediction of common time properties of models at runtime and make the synchronization of behaviors and structural changes easier.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Reference Autonomous Mobility Model (RAMM). The RAMM serves as the mission-level mobility modeling tool that is currently lacking in the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) community. The RAMM is built on the framework already established by trusted mobility modeling tools to fill the current analysis gap in the autonomous vehicle acquisition cycle.

The fishing vessels are typically at sea for 5-7 days at a stretch completely cut off from the land. In a low-cost offshore communication system for fishermen currently being developed, a multilevel P2MP backhaul network connects clusters of boats at the fishing zones. Each cluster forms a wireless mesh network with multiple potential gateways to the backhaul network. This work proposes a resilient lightweight protocol for optimized dynamic provisioning of the backhaul network based on an adaptive, demand driven algorithm. A local controller, capable of running on any access router, selects the optimal subset of gateways so that the rest can be reconfigured as mobile base stations or switched to power saver mode. It assigns every boat in a cluster to the most appropriate gateway maximizing the utilization of gateways. A proof-of-concept implementation has been done with a hardware test bed and the results are very encouraging."

In existing work, robots have mostly influenced group behaviors of animals. We explore the possibilities of mixing robots with natural plants, merging useful attributes. Significant synergies arise by combining the plants' ability to efficiently produce shaped material and the robots' ability to extend sensing and decision-making behaviors. However, programming robots to control plant motion and shape requires good knowledge of complex plant behaviors. Therefore, we use machine learning to create a holistic plant model and evolve robot controllers. As a benchmark task we choose obstacle avoidance. We use computer vision to construct a model of plant stem stiffening and motion dynamics by training an LSTM network. The LSTM network acts as a forward model predicting change in the plant, driving the evolution of neural network robot controllers. The evolved controllers augment the plants' natural light-finding and tissue-stiffening behaviors to avoid obstacles and grow desired shapes. We successfully verify the robot controllers and bio-hybrid behavior in reality, with a physical setup and actual plants."

Existing ankle rehabilitation robots usually use torquemeters and multiaxis load cells for measuring joint dynamics. These measurements are accurate, but the contribution as a result of muscles and ligaments is not taken into account. Some computational ankle models have been developed to evaluate ligament strain and joint torque. These models do not include muscles and, thus, are not suitable for an overall ankle assessment in robot-assisted therapy. Methods: This study proposed a computational ankle model for use in robot-assisted therapy with three rotational degrees of freedom, 12 muscles, and seven ligaments. This model is driven by robotics, uses three independent position variables as inputs, and outputs an overall ankle assessment. Subject-specific adaptations by geometric and strength scaling were also made to allow for a universal model. Results: This model was evaluated using published results and experimental data from 11 participants. Results show a high accuracy in the evaluation of ligament neutral length and passive joint torque. The subject-specific adaptation performance is high, with each normalized root-mean-square deviation value less than 10%. Conclusion: This model could be used for ankle assessment, especially in evaluating passive ankle torque, for a specific individual. The characteristic that is unique to this model is the use of three independent position variables that can be measured in real time as inputs, which makes it advantageous over other models when combined with robot-assisted therapy."

It contributes dedicated abstractions to conveniently structure and implement collaborative behavior and thus, addresses the complexity challenge. To evaluate NaoText specifications, we introduce an interpreter architecture that is based on (REST) as a lightweight and flexible infrastructure for communication among robot teams.

The key challenge is for the embedded systems, on which the bulk of these applications will be deployed, to maintain real-time performance in the midst of the exponential increase in spatial and temporal visual data. For example, a useful vision-based driver assistance system needs to locate and identify critical objects such as pedestrians, other vehicles, pot-holes, animals, and street signs with latency small enough to allow a human driver to react accordingly. In this work, we propose a digital accelerator architecture for a high-throughput, robust, scalable, and tunable visual object detection pipeline based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. From a systems perspective, efficacy can be measured in terms of speed, accuracy, energy efficiency and scalability in performing such visual tasks. Since each application dictates the criticality of any one of these dimensions, our proposed architecture exposes design-time parameters that can take advantage of domain-specific knowledge while supporting tune-ability through run-time configurations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our vision accelerator we map the architecture to a modern FPGA and demonstrate full HD video processing at 30 fps (frames per second) operating at a conservative 100 MHz clock. Evaluations on a single object class show throughput improvements of 2× and 5× over GPU and multi-threaded CPU implementations respectively. Further more we provide a pathway for enhanced scalability for the many-class problem and achieve over 20× improvement over an equivalent CPU implementation for 5 object classes."

Compared with existing models, the proposed model introduces a dynamic basic probability assignment (BPA) to the decision-level fusion such that the weight of each feature source can change dynamically with the real-time fatigue feature measurements. Further, the proposed model can combine the fatigue state at the previous time step in the decision-level fusion to improve the robustness of the fatigue driving recognition. An improved correction strategy of the BPA is also proposed to accommodate the decision conflict caused by external disturbances. Results from field experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are better than thoseof models based on a single fatigue feature and/or single-source information fusion, especially when the most effective fatigue features are used in the proposed model."

It then automatically selects a testing tool capable of validating any technology-specific features, generates an automated test script, and runs it on the web application. Test generation is performed using a model-driven approach which encodes test cases in a platform independent manner, and transforms them into platform specific tests using a model of various web technologies.

However, mobile devices have limited computing power and resources. An effective approach to remedying the problem is for mobile apps to subscribe cloud services, called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). However, there exist two potential problems in MCC; low quality of service (QoS) and limited manageability. Managing MCC is challenging mainly due to performance degradation due to the network-based service invocations, dynamism caused by mobility, high heterogeneity on mobile platforms and services and the overhead for managing various elements of MCC which are highly distributed in nature. To provide a comprehensive and practical solution for MCC, in this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing process and its managementrelated methods. We first define an extended meta-model of MCC with self-stabilizing related elements. And, we define a main process for self-stabilization and a supplementary process of optimal clustering. We conduct experiments with the proposed process and methods, and the result shows that the self-stabilization and its methods are effective in stabilizing MCC in presence of QoS degradation and severe resource drains. © 2012 IEEE."

Hybrid automata can be used to model system-level behaviors for the large category of systems that exhibit strong couplings between discrete and continuous dynamics. Many software tools have been developed for hybrid automata to enable model-based design of embedded systems and these software tools are constructed by using their own modeling languages. Model-based design frameworks, such as Model-Integrated Computing (MIC), Model Driven Architecture (MDA), and Model Driven Design (MDD), have been advocated to raise the level of abstraction in software tool design by placing stronger emphasis on the use of software models in the software tool design process. In particular, MIC places strong emphasis on the use of Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) and model transformations in design flows. Practical and effective development of formal specifications for DSML semantics within model-based tools can be challenging, but could positively impact adoption and reuse of these tools. The semantic anchoring methodology was developed to address this challenge by formally tying DSMLs to a ""semantic unit"", which is a formal specification that captures the operational semantics of a specific model of computation. Leveraging our prior work with semantic units, we develop a semantic unit for hybrid automata.

This spacecraft architecture poses novel software challenges because the hardware platform is inherently distributed, with highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. It is critical for mission success to support autonomous fault management and to satisfy real-time performance requirements. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple organizations and users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The operating system provides primitives for concurrency, synchronization, and secure information flows; it also enforces application separation and resource management policies. The middleware provides higher-level services supporting request/response and publish/subscribe interactions for distributed software. The component model facilitates the creation of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. Two cross-cutting aspects - multi-level security and multi-layered fault management - are addressed at all levels of the architecture. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a dedicated modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation. © 2012 IEEE."

Precise timing of software and firmware operations is critical to many functions within a space system, including coordination of hardware components, scheduling of spacecraft resources, and execution of communications protocols. RITES provides a highly expressive and precise mechanism to specify when software and firmware operations occur. The programming languages commonly used to develop the software and firmware for space systems (i.e. C, C++, and Verilog) do not have a built-in semantic concept of time. In contrast, RITES allows the specification of scheduled behaviors to be made and modified using concepts natural to the scheduling problem and with a compact, intuitive syntax. RITES components coordinate the activities and temporal behavior of other modules within the system rather than encapsulating complete system behavior. The RITES language is supported by a family of code generators that produce executable implementations of RITES programs. Code generators translate RITES programs to C functions for execution as software on sequential processors and to Verilog hardware description language (HDL) modules for execution within Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Additional code generators produce HDL implementations with error tolerance features allowing execution on FPGAs susceptible to single event effects (SEEs) in environments with significant radiation. Specifically, RITES modules may be automatically implemented as Verilog with local or distributed triple modular redundancy (TMR). We provide several examples of the implementation of precision timed behavior at various timing granularities, including clock-by-clock control of a digital signal processing (DSP) core within an FPGA for efficient execution of signal processing applications, implementation of a time division multiple access (TDMA) radio communications protocol, and a detailed study of the configuration and control of an external image compression ASIC. © 2014 IEEE."

In this work a numerically efficient implementation of a sigma-point Kalman filter is applied to the attitude and relative position estimation of a small-size tethered unmanned helicopter. For that purpose, the state prediction is performed using a kinematic process model driven by measurements of the inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) onboard the helicopter and the subsequent correction is done using information from additional sensors like magnetometer, radar altimeter and magnetic encoders measuring the tether orientation relative to the helicopter. Assuming the tether is kept taut by an actuated device on ground during the system operation, this approach avoids the need of a global positioning system (GPS) as the position is estimated relative to the anchor point.

It ensures that the vehicle can change its motion softly and meet real-time optimal control requirements of systems with jumping parameters. The strong nonlinear dynamics and interaction characteristics of electric vehicle result in large model uncertainties and the conventional robust or parameter adaptive control methods can hardly ensure the stability and accuracy of vehicle motion without delay. A conventional adaptive vehicle model, an assigned initial value vehicle model and multiple fixed models are established to identify the vehicle dynamic characteristic in parallel. Multiple fixed vehicle models can improve the transient performance. Moreover, we ensure the stability of vehicle systems by the conventional adaptive vehicle and further enhance vehicle transient performance by the assigned initial value adaptive vehicle model. The best sub-model is selected as global model according to the switching index, and a stair-like generalized predictive controller is designed for this model in electric vehicle. Due to the GPC method employed in the design, the computation complexity and cost are greatly reduced. As a result, the vehicle delivers superior performance in hazardous driving conditions."

To continuously perform analytics on the fly within the stream, state-of-the-art DSMSs host streaming applications as a set of interconnected operators, with each operator encapsulating the semantic of a specific operation. For parallel execution on a particular platform, these operators need to be appropriately replicated in multiple instances that split and process the workload simultaneously. Because the way operators are partitioned affects the resulting performance of streaming applications, it is essential for DSMSs to have a method to compare different operators and make holistic replication decisions to avoid performance bottlenecks and resource wastage. To this end, we propose a stepwise profiling approach to optimize application performance on a given execution platform. It automatically scales distributed computations over streams based on application features and processing power of provisioned resources and builds the relationship between provisioned resources and application performance metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the resulting configuration. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach successfully fulfills its goals with minimal profiling overhead."

Our intention is to put intelligent agents into a simulated natural context and verify if the principles developed in the real world could also be used in understanding an artificially-created intelligent population. To achieve this, we simulate a large-scale predator-prey world, where the laws of the world are designed by only the findings or logical equivalence that have been discovered in nature. We endow the agents with the intelligence based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In order to scale the population size up to millions agents, a large-scale DRL training platform with redesigned experience buffer is proposed. Our results show that the population dynamics of AI agents, driven only by each agent's individual self-interest, reveals an ordered pattern that is similar to the Lotka-Volterra model studied in population biology. We further discover the emergent behaviors of collective adaptations in studying how the agents' grouping behaviors will change with the environmental resources. Both of the two findings could be explained by the self-organization theory in nature."

However, there are great challenges to realize active control strategy, since the operator's motion intention is uneasy to be recognized by robotics online. The purpose of this paper is to propose a subject-specific electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal model to estimate subject's joint torque in real time, which can be used to detect his/her motion intention by forward dynamics, and then to explore its potential applications in rehabilitation robotics control. The musculoskeletal model uses muscle activation dynamics to extract muscle activation from raw EMG signals, a Hill-type muscle-tendon model to calculate muscle contraction force, and a proposed subject-specific musculoskeletal geometry model to calculate muscular moment arm. The parameters of muscle activation dynamics and muscle-tendon model are identified by off-line optimization methods in order to minimize the differences between the estimated muscular torques and the reference torques. Validation experiments were conducted on six healthy subjects to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrated the model's ability to predict knee joint torque with the coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.934±0.013 and the normalized root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 11.58%±1.44%."

Most of these robots are connected to remote-control cameras. In certain circumstances, video images of these robot systems cannot provide clear relative positional relationship between the topography where the job is being done and the device at the top end of the machine, resulting in a degradation in operating efficiency. On the other hand, dangerous situations that potentially involve secondary accidents will be encountered if the survey team approaches the site where soil collapse or building breakdown has occurred for the purposes of survey and of laying the work markers. Against such a background, there is a demand for construction robots that could make the best use of information about the design, the present topographic features, and so on.

This paper describes a 3D simulation software that is installed to generate command values by which the robot machine, typically a hydraulic shovel, actuates the top-end device. This actuation is effected depending on the machine's boom and arm angles that are calculated through inverse kinematics from the coordinates of the bucket tip."

In this paper, we develop an algorithmfor planning admissible trajectories for nonholonomic systems that will take the system from one point in its configuration space to another. Inour algorithm the independent variables are first converged to their desired values. Subsequently, closed trajectories of the independent variables are used to converge the dependent variables. We use Green’s theoremin our algorithm to convert the problem of finding a closed path into that of finding a surface area in the space of the independent variables such that the dependent variablesconverge to their desired values as theindependent variables traverse alongthe boundary of this surface area. Using this approach, we specifically address issues related to the reachability of the system, motion planning amidst additional constraints, and repeatable motion of nonholonomic systems.

However, the sensing devices continuously generate a large amount of data, which consumes much resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy and storage), and may sacrifice the quality-of-service (QoS) of applications. Prior work has demonstrated that there is significant redundancy in the content of the sensed data. By judiciously reducing the redundant data, the data size and the load can be significantly reduced, thereby reducing resource cost, facilitating the timely delivery of unique, probably critical information and enhancing QoS. This paper presents a survey of existing works for the mobile crowdsensing strategies with emphasis on reducing the resource cost and achieving high QoS. We start by introducing the motivation for this survey, and present the necessary background of crowdsensing and IoT. We then present various mobile crowdsensing strategies and discuss their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the future research directions for mobile crowdsensing. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, systems and applications related to mobile crowdsensing and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyze and compare the strategies proposed in the prior works but also to discuss their applicability towards the IoT, and provide the guidance on the future research direction of mobile crowdsensing."

For such full-fledged, complex software systems, a methodologically sound engineering approach in terms of model-driven engineering (MDE) is crucial. Several modeling approaches have already been proposed that capture the ubiquitous nature of web applications, each of them having different origins, pursuing different goals and providing a pantheon of concepts. This paper aims to give an in-depth comparison of seven modeling approaches supporting the development of UWAs. This methodology is conducted by applying a detailed set of evaluation criteria and by demonstrating its applicability on basis of an exemplary tourism web application. In particular, five commonly found ubiquitous scenarios are investigated, thus providing initial insight into the modeling concepts of each approach as well as to facilitate their comparability. The results gained indicate that many modeling approaches lack a proper MDE foundation in terms of meta-models and tool support. The proposed modeling mechanisms for ubiquity are often limited, since they neither cover all relevant context factors in an explicit, self-contained, and extensible way, nor allow for a wide spectrum of extensible adaptation operations. The provided modeling concepts frequently do not allow dealing with all different parts of a web application in terms of its content, hypertext, and presentation levels as well as their structural and behavioral features. Finally, current modeling approaches do not reflect the crosscutting nature of ubiquity but rather intermingle context and adaptation issues with the core parts of a web application, thus hampering maintainability and extensibility. Different from other surveys in the area of modeling web applications, this paper specifically considers modeling concepts for their ubiquitous nature, together with an investigation of available support for MDD in a comprehensive way, using a well-defined as well as fine-grained catalogue of more than 30 evaluation criteria. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

In this paper, we propose a technological solution based on software agents, which allows supporting the management of collaborative processes in environments of dynamic collaborative networks. We present a methodology for coordinating healthcare services through collaborative processes to enable organizations providing integrated care services and continuous process improvements. This methodology includes methods based on Model-Driven Development, which enable the generation of executable process models and the code of the process-oriented agents, derived from conceptual models of collaborative processes. The methodology and methods are implemented and automated by software agents that enable the generation of the technological solution, at run-time on the platform. Furthermore, we propose an agent-based platform that enables organizations to negotiate collaboration agreements in electronic format to establish collaborative networks, as well as a definition of the collaborative processes to be executed. In this way, the proposed agent-based platform allows collaborations among heterogeneous and autonomous healthcare organizations focusing on the process-oriented integration, enabling us to provide integrated healthcare services."

The secure and reliable use of Cruise Control (CC) with Cloud and Edge Cloud to achieve complete autonomy for a vehicle is a key component and a major challenge for ITS. This research unravels the complications that arise when Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is incorporated into a collaborative environment. It mainly answers the question of where to securely compute Collaborative Cruise Control's (CCC) data in a connected environment. To address this, the paper initially reviews previous research in the domain of Vehicular Cloud, ITS architecture, related threat modelling approaches, and secure implementations of ACC. An overview application model for CCC is developed for performing a threat analysis with the purpose of investigating the reasons why a vehicle suffers collision. Through the use of interviews, the research analyses and suggests the location of computational data by creating a taxonomy between the Edge Cloud, Cloud and the On-board Unit (OBU) while validating the model."
A three-level non-deterministic modeling methodology for the \NVH\ behavior of rubber connections,"Stenti, A.;Moens, D.;Sas, P.;Desmet, W.",Journal of Sound and Vibration,2010,ScienceDirect,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Journal of Sound and Vibration,2010-03-29,10.1016/j.jsv.2009.10.016,2-s2.0-71049164153,,"Complex built-up structures such as vehicles have a variety of joint types, such as spot-welds, bolted joints, rubber joints, etc. Rubber joints highly contribute to the nonlinear level of the structure and are a major source of uncertainties and variability. In the general framework of developing engineering tools for virtual prototyping and product refinement, the modeling of the NVH behavior of rubber joints involve the computational burden of including a detailed nonlinear model of the joint and the uncertainties and variability typical of that joint in a full-scale system model. However, in an engineering design phase the knowledge on the joint rubber material properties is typically poor, and the working conditions a rubber joint will experience are generally not known in detail. This lack of knowledge often do not justify the computational burden and the modeling effort of including detailed nonlinear models of the joint in a full-scale system model. Driven by these issues a non-deterministic numerical methodology based on a three-level modeling approach is being developed. The methodology aims at evaluating directly in the frequency domain the sensitivity of the NVH behavior of a full-scale system model to the rubber joint material properties when nonlinear visco-elastic rubber material behavior is considered. Rather than including directly in the model a representation of the rubber nonlinear visco-elastic behavior, the methodology proposes to model the material nonlinear visco-elastic behavior by using a linear visco-elastic material model defined in an interval sense, from which the scatter on the full-scale system NVH response is evaluated. Furthermore the development of a multi-level solution scheme allows to reduce the computational burden introduced by the non-deterministic approach by allowing the definition of an equivalent linear interval parametric rubber joint model, ready to be assembled in a full-scale system model at a reasonable computational cost. By using a commercial finite element code the developed methodology is illustrated through a numerical case-study: the low-frequency dynamic analysis of automotive door weather-strip seals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the use of MDD takes from developers most of the development effort, there is still much left to them if we consider the need for adapting and providing agents with a sophisticated behaviour. Moreover, there is limited work evaluating the benefits provided by MDD in the context of agent-based systems. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported development method that applies MDD techniques to design and implement agents based on the belief-desire-intention architecture with a sophisticated plan selection process. We evaluated our approach with a user study, and results suggest that the use of our tool-supported development method can potentially ease the process of understanding and developing agent-based systems when facing them for the first time."

In many cases, there is much to be gained by merging multiple open architecture components within a single system. One such case is with the Navy's Common Control System (CCS) architecture utilized by the Multi-robot Operator Control Unit version 4 (MOCU4). CCS has primarily focused on Group 3-5 aircraft whereas MOCU4 is focused on ground and maritime unmanned vehicles. To utilize both of these architectures within a single system, a translation architecture called the SAE JAUS Vehicle Interface Service (VIS) has been designed and implemented by the MOCU4 team at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems (SPAWAR) Center Pacific (SSC Pacific). This paper will explore the design considerations and decisions of this VIS, as well as provide details of its implementation. It will also describe briefly how the VIS has been developed and utilized for the following projects: Navy Common Control System (CCS) integration with Large Training Vehicle (LTV), Control Station Human Machine Interface (CaSHMI), and the Universal Tactical Controller (UTC) for the Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS(I))."

However, the conventional deep computation model involves a large number of parameters. Typically, training a deep computation model with millions of parameters needs highperformance servers with large-scale memory and powerful computing units, limiting the growth of the model size for multimedia feature learning on common devices such as portable CPUs and conventional desktops. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a Tucker deep computation model by using the Tucker decomposition to compress the weight tensors in the full-connected layers for multimedia feature learning. Furthermore, a learning algorithm based on the back-propagation strategy is devised to train the parameters of the Tucker deep computation model. Finally, the performance of the Tucker deep computation model is evaluated by comparing with the conventional deep computation model on two representative multimedia datasets, that is, CUAVE and SNAE2, in terms of accuracy drop, parameter reduction, and speedup in the experiments. Results imply that the Tucker deep computation model can achieve a large-parameter reduction and speedup with a small accuracy drop for multimedia feature learning."

Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7, a specialized platform supporting the function of the Smartphone to compete with other Smartphone platforms. Although Windows Phone 7 now supports only the Smartphone it is expected to support a variety of smart devices to compete with iOS and Android in the near future. Currently, it is difficult to develop applications for various smart devices upon a single platform because each smart device has its own hardware and user interface. To cope with this problem, a platform as well as a modeling environment must be extended to support various devices. In this paper, we move our focus to the extension of the modeling environment. To be more specifically we suggest the extended metamodel for modeling applications based on Windows Phone 7 using the UML extension mechanism. To do this, we analyze Windows Phone 7's features and classify them with respect to software elements and hardware resources. Therefore, software and hardware can be modeled independently and furthermore even if a new smart device based on Windows Phone 7 is introduced the modeling elements for the applications operated on the new device can be extended easily. © 2011 IEEE."

The computational requirements of advanced numerical tools for simulating material behavior such as the finite element method (FEM) and the molecular dynamics method (MD) can prohibit direct integration of these tools in a design optimization procedure where multiple iterations are required. The complexity of multiphase material behavior at multiple scales restricts the development of a comprehensive meta-model that can be used to replace the multiscale analysis. One, therefore, requires a design approach that can incorporate multiple simulations (multi-physics) of varying fidelity such as FEM and MD in an iterative model management framework that can significantly reduce design cycle times. In this research a material design tool based on a variable fidelity model management framework is presented. In the variable fidelity material design tool, complex ""high fidelity"" FEM analyses are performed only to guide the analytic ""low-fidelity"" model toward the optimal material design. The tool is applied to obtain the optimal distribution of a second phase, consisting of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers, in a silicon-nitride (Si3N4) matrix to obtain continuous fiber SiC-Si3N4 ceramic composites (CFCCs) with optimal fracture toughness. Using the variable fidelity material design tool in application to one test problem, a reduction in design cycle time around 80 percent is achieved as compared to using a conventional design optimization approach that exclusively calls the high fidelity FEM.

However, when high-speed movements and/or heavy load transportation are required, it becomes essential to consider the robot dynamics as well. The control signals generated by most dynamic controllers reported in the literature are torques or voltages for the robot motors, while commercial robots usually accept velocity commands. In this context, we present a velocity-based dynamic model for differential drive mobile robots that also includes the dynamics of the robot actuators. Such model has linear and angular velocities as inputs and has been included in Peter Corke’s Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB, therefore it can be easily integrated into simulation systems that have been built for the unicycle kinematics. We demonstrate that the proposed dynamic model has useful mathematical properties. We also present an application of such model on the design of an adaptive dynamic controller and the stability analysis of the complete system, while applying the proposed model properties. Finally, we show some simulation and experimental results and discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed model."

To some extent this is also driven by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) which encompasses aspects from both automation as well as cloud computing. However, for rolling out automation software as a service solutions to low-end, long-tail markets with thousands of small customers important aspects for cloud scalability such as easy self service for the customer are still missing. There exists a large gap between the engineering efforts required to configure an automation system and the effort automation companies and their customers can afford. At the same time, tools for implementing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have recently become more and more efficient and easy to use. Tailored DSLs that make use of abstractions for the particular (sub-)domains and omitting other complexities would allow customers to handle their applications in a SaaS-oriented, self-service manner. In this paper we present a view-based approach for engineering languages for a multi-domain automation cloud platform that facilitates modern DSL frameworks. This will allow automation SaaS providers to rapidly design sub-domain specific engineering tools based on a common platform.

The specific target identification was designed first. Then the visual system acquired images and processed the images, which could eliminate the noise extraction boundary to obtain the useful information in the images. After that, use the Hough transform to extract the straight lines in the target images. The position and attitude estimation method is proposed based on geometric relations between the straight lines in the target identification on the deck and in the images acquired by the camera. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithm was verified by tests."

In this paper, a new visual attention model based on dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) used for ship detection is proposed. It is a bottom-up visual attention model driven by data rather than by task. First, the input image is converted from RGB color space to HIS color space. Second, the modulus of DWT is analyzed to obtain the conspicuity map of each feature. Third, the conspicuity maps are combined into the saliency map nonlinearly, different from Itti's method, the contribution rate of each conspicuity map to final saliency map is not equal. It is relevant to the difference between the level of the most active region and the average level of the other active regions in each conspicuity map. Finally, the detection result of ships based on saliency map is got by region growing method, where the seed is obtained from the saliency map and the growing process is implemented in intensity image. Experiments on natural ship images show that our method is robust and efficient compared with Itti's and Hou's method. © 2012 IEEE."

We model the task of spoken language understanding as a successive classification problem. The first classifier (topic classifier) is used to identify the topic of an input utterance. With the restriction of the recognized target topic, the second classifier (semantic classifier) is trained to extract the corresponding slot-value pairs. It is mainly data-driven and requires only minimally annotated corpus for training whilst retaining the understanding robustness and deepness for spoken language. Most importantly, it allows the employment of weakly supervised strategies for training the two classifiers. We first apply the training strategy of combining active learning and self-training (Tur et al., 2005) for topic classifier. Also, we propose a practical method for bootstrapping the topic-dependent semantic classifiers from a small amount of labeled sentences.

Furthermore, the resulting code is more clean and concise than ad-hoc code, as it focuses only on the implementation of the control law.

The tools used in our data collection process include the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) paradigm and a driving simulator. The WOZ paradigm utilizes a wizard (experimenter), behaving as an intelligent computer application, that interacts with a participant during simulated driving. Data collection takes place during simulated driving due to the impact that one's current location in an environment and the driving situation can have on the type of language used (i.e., utterances) and the manner in which the language is spoken (i.e., prosody). During simulated driving, participants perform domain-specific tasks with what we characterize as a task-constrained language-unconstrained approach. The goal of this approach is to strike a balance between tasks that do not sufficiently constrain participants speech and those that constrain speech too much."

From the educational point of view, the use of mobile devices is leading to an adaptation and modification of teaching and learning processes that require teachers to adjust their methodology to the interests and motivations of the students of the XXI century. Today, any space or environment in which a subject unfolds becomes a ubiquitous and personalized learning space, open to new discoveries and in which learning in both conventional and unconventional contexts thereby multiplies personal, social and professional opportunities in a world in which the changes occur at a high rate. To train competent citizens, able to express themselves in many and varied situations, contexts and realities it is necessary to provide them with rich, exciting and vibrant learning scenarios where the only task is not only to learn but also to develop, acquire and implement new educational opportunities. In this track we intend to reunite all research in the field of educational mobile technologies, which play an important role in the autonomous use that students make of these resources to enhance the skills acquired in the classroom. In this sense, the communications presented, confirm that to an increasingly greater extent, teachers are making a good use of mobile technologies in education thereby reducing the existing gap between the educational sphere and the reality experienced by students in their daily lives."

However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the determinants of acceptance of driverless shuttles in large cross-national samples. In the present study, we surveyed 10,000 respondents on the acceptance of driverless vehicles and sociodemographic characteristics, using a 94-item online questionnaire. After data filtering, data of 7,755 respondents from 116 countries were retained. Respondents reported that they would enjoy taking a ride in a driverless vehicle (mean = 4.90 on a scale from 1 = disagree strongly to 6 = agree strongly). We further found that the scores on the questionnaire items were most appropriately explained through a general acceptance component, which had loadings of about 0.7 for items pertaining to the usefulness of driverless vehicles and loadings between 0.5 and 0.6 for items concerning the intention to use, ease of use, pleasure, and trust in driverless vehicles, as well as knowledge of mobility-related developments. Additional components were identified as thrill seeking, wanting to be in control manually, supporting a car-free environment, and being comfortable with technology. Correlations between sociodemographic characteristics and general acceptance scores were small (<0.20), yet interpretable (e.g., people who reported difficulty with finding a parking space were more accepting towards driverless vehicles). Finally, we found that the GDP per capita of the respondents' country was predictive of countries' mean general acceptance score (ρ=-0.48 across 43 countries with 25 or more respondents). In conclusion, self-reported acceptance of driverless vehicles is more strongly determined by domain-specific attitudes than by sociodemographic characteristics. We recommend further research, using objective measures, into the hypothesis that national characteristics are a predictor of the acceptance of driverless vehicles."

Acrux uses dead-reckoning, the approach that gives probably the best chance at a completely autonomous indoor localization system. Unfortunately, it has not been mastered on smartphones beyond a few dozen meters due to its inherent integration drift. As a result, all dead-reckoning based solutions in literature require periodic recalibration using input from outside – attaching strings preventing indoor localization from becoming mainstream. While it is virtually impossible to completely eliminate integration drift, Acrux is the first solution to succeed in dead-reckoning with meter level accuracy for several hundred meters, enough to relax the requirement for periodic recalibration in most indoor scenarios. To accomplish this, Acrux replaces step-counting, the standard approach for measuring distance using sensors, with an approach that measures the speed of locomotion. Although a straightforward accurate estimation of motion speed using the erroneous sensors found on smartphones is infeasible, Acrux combines a novel approach with measurement based analysis to achieve that. Leveraging its excellent dead-reckoning capability, Acrux is shown to provide indoor localization with median error between 0.7 m and 1.2 m and 98% percentile error of 3 m in a dozen of scenarios in 4 different buildings – without any recalibration."

In this paper, we propose a tooled approach that enables researchers and engineers to design and integrate adaptation mechanisms into software systems through FCLs. It consists of a domain-specific modeling language that raises the level of abstraction on which FCLs are defined, making them amenable to automated analysis and implementation code synthesis. The language supports composition, distribution and reflection, thereby enabling coordination and composition of multiple distributed FCLs. Its use is facilitated by a modeling environment, ACTRESS, that provides support for modeling, verification and complete code generation. We report on its application to a concrete adaptation case study and also discuss resulting properties. Copyright 2014 ACM."

Before the testing (inference) phases in practical use, sophisticated training (learning) phases are required, calling for efficient training methods with higher accuracy and shorter converging time. Many existing studies focus on the training optimization on high-performance servers or computing clusters, e.g. GPU clusters. However, training neural networks on resource-constrained devices, e.g. mobile platforms, is an important research topic barely touched. In this paper, we implement AdaLearner-an adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks that trains a single network with heterogenous mobile resources under the same local network in parallel. To exploit the potential of our system, we adapt neural networks training phase to mobile device-wise resources and fiercely decrease the transmission overhead for better system scalability. On three representative neural network structures trained from two image classification datasets, AdaLearner boosts the training phase significantly. For example, on LeNet, 1.75-3.37X speedup is achieved when increasing the worker nodes from 2 to 8, thanks to the achieved high execution parallelism and excellent scalability."

However, the modeling of platform independent models for adaptivity in the logical design phase remains rather neglected causing a gap between the analysis and the technical design phase. To overcome this situation, we propose an approach called Adapt Cases. Adapt Cases allow the explicit modeling of adaptivity with domain-specific means, enabling adaptivity to gather attention early in the software engineering process. Since our approach is based on the concept of use cases it is easy adoptable in new and even running projects that use the UML as a specification language, and additionally, can be easily incorporated into model-based development environments. © 2011 ACM."

Several approaches use an architectural model as a runtime representation of a managed system for monitoring, reasoning and performing adaptation. To ease the causal connection between a system and a model, these models are often closely related to the implementation and at a rather low level of abstraction. This makes them as complex as the implementation and it impedes reusability and extensibility of autonomic managers. Moreover, the models often do not cover different concerns, like security or performance, and therefore they do not support several self-management capabilities at once. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach that provides multiple architectural runtime models at different levels of abstraction as a basis for adaptation. Each runtime model abstracts from the underlying system and platform leveraging reusability and extensibility of managers that work on these models. Moreover, each model focuses on a specific concern which simplifies the work of autonomic managers. The different models are maintained automatically at runtime using model-driven engineering techniques that also reduce development efforts.

We investigate how a robot achieves adaptive walking during such turning by focusing on rhythm control and propose a locomotion control system that generates robot motions by rhythmic signals from internal oscillators and modulates signal generation based on touch sensor signals. First, we verify that the robot attains limit cycles of straight and curved walking by numerical simulations and hardware experiments. Second, we examine the transition between these walking patterns based on the basin of attraction of the limit cycles in numerical simulations. Finally, we verify whether the robot actually accomplishes transition and turning by hardware experiments. This paper clarifies that the robot establishes such turning motions by adequate modulation of walking rhythm and phase through interactions between the dynamics of its mechanical system, oscillators, and environment. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

These networks adapt during development by selective reinforcement of major transport routes and recycling of the intervening redundant material to support further extension. In the case of fungi, the predicted transport efficiency of the weighted network is better than evenly weighted networks with the same topology, or standard reference networks. Experimentally, nutrient movement can be mapped using radio-tracers and scintillation imaging, and shows more complex transport dynamics, with synchronized oscillations and switching between different pre-existing routes. The significance of such dynamics to the interplay between transport control and topology is not yet known. In a similar manner, the resilience of the network can be tested in silico and experimentally using grazing invertebrates. Both approaches suggest that the same structures that confer good transport efficiency also show good resilience, with the persistence of a centrally connected core. The acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum also forms efficient networks between food sources, with a good balance between total cost, transit distance and fault tolerance. In this case, network formation can be captured by a mathematical model driven by non-linear positive reinforcement of tubes with high flux, and decay of tubes with low flux. We argue that organization of these simple planar networks has been honed by evolution, and they may exemplify potential solutions to real-world compromises between search strategy, transport efficiency, resilience and cost in other domains. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The coordinator attempts to determine the real state of the agent system in the face of multiple diagnoses, then selects a course of action from a collection of potentially conflicting defense actions. In this selection process, it takes into account both any uncertainty about the exact nature of a perceived problem and any high-level policy defining the relative importance of application properties such as completeness, timeliness and security.

In the mobility domain, commodities such as shared cars or electric vehicle charging services have multiple free parameters that determine their utility to customers. Additionally, sales of individual service items are interdependent, meaning each sale of a service items impacts all consecutive sales. In this thesis, our goal is to concisely describe structure of these commodities and to develop pricing algorithms that improve revenue of service providers and the quality of allocations of these commodities. To this end, we describe the interdependent commodities multi-agent pricing problem model and develop markov decision process based pricing strategy that improves both service provider revenue and resource utilization in the electric vehicle charging domain."

The sensing needs of many other potential information consumers might thus be served by sharing such sensors, thereby allowing other information consumers to opportunistically task them during their otherwise unscheduled time, as well as enabling other improvements, such as decreasing the number of platforms needed to achieve a goal and increasing the resilience of sensor tasks through duplication. We have implemented a prototype system realizing these goals in Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP), which leverages an agent-based representation of tasks and sensors to enable fast, effective, and adaptive opportunistic sharing of airborne sensors. Using a simulated large-scale disaster-response scenario populated with publicly available Geographic Information System (GIS) datasets, we demonstrate that correlations in task location are likely to lead to a high degree of potential for sensor-sharing. We then validate that our implementation of MTIP can successfully carry out such sharing, showing that it increases the number of sensor tasks served, reduces the number of platforms required to serve a given set of sensor tasks, and adapts well to radical changes in flight path."

In this context, various QoS descriptive frameworks and Web services technologies (such as WSDL and BPEL) are being considered as the most affordable solutions to promote the performance of decentralized e-services, through applying strategies like QoS ontologies and related optimization algorithms globally or locally. Nonetheless, most P2P-based service selection and composition approaches applied nowadays lack dynamism and autonomy. In this paper, we first propose an extension of non-functional properties in WSMO, so that to globally facilitate dynamism and autonomous coordination in service compositions. Furthermore, taking into account a model driven pproach, we design a planning algorithm to intelligently assign composition tasks to the most appropriate peers for diferent steps in a whole process.

Depending on the domain, this can include loss of lives, injuries and economic or environmental disasters. For example, a common hazard in the aviation domain is in flight engine shutdown. Hazard analysis is the process of discovering hazards in a system. This activity has been performed for many years in safety engineering and is a straightforward activity in most domains. In recent years a new class of systems has emerged, distinguished from traditional (monolithic) systems by a combination of characteristics such as autonomous and independently developed components, increased complexity and geographic dispersion. These characteristics introduce a number of challenges for traditional hazard analysis. This paper describes these challenges and proposes two complementary approaches that address them: Dependability Deviation Analysis (DDA) and simulation-based hazard analysis (SimHAZAN). The paper then describes a model-driven approach that combines the two and thereby provides an underlying framework for their application during system development. © 2009 IEEE."

Many dynamic platforms exist that achieve this to some extent, and that are built on general-purpose languages (GPLs). However, these approaches suffer from standard difficulties of GPLs relating to the lack of semantic expressiveness of their constructs. In this paper, we describe high-level declarative constructs that can be used to specify the adaptation of application behaviour to specific situations. The language is supported by a framework that enables the exchange and merge of behaviours on-the-fly.

On the other hand, the polarized attention to task-specific solutions makes them hard to reuse, customize, and combine. In this paper we propose a family of domain-specific modeling languages for the specification of civilian missions of mobile multi-robot systems. These missions are meant to be described in terms of models that are (i) closer to the general problem domain, (ii) independent from the underlying technologies, (iii) ready to be analyzed, simulated, and executed, and (iv) extensible to new application domains, thus opening up the use of robots to even non-technical operators. Moreover, we show the applicability of the proposed family of languages in two real-world application domains: unmanned multicopters and autonomous underwater vehicles."

This study re-evaluates the relationships among the human factor measures of the UTAUT model in assessing its applicability to a cultural context of a different country. The data for this study were obtained through a self-administered survey of Nigerian University students and the model was estimated using structural equation modeling framework. The findings of this study confirmed and contradicted some UTAUT relationships. This shows that country’s level of cultural differences to a large extent moderates the interactions of the UTAUT effects as such direct application of information system models validated by other cultures might be detrimental as vital relationships determining the adoption of such of technology might not be revealed. The finding of this study provides policy makers of educational institutions and industry practitioners with an appropriate model that can be used to assess the level of adoption of mobile learning and other learning technologies in Nigeria and similar countries of the same cultural context.

In addition to the redundancy resolution, as the rover moves on uneven terrain the wheel and ground contact has to be ensured. The KSOM network is first trained using forward kinematics model of the rover manipulator system, with manipulability measure and joint angles of the manipulator serving as constraints.

Analog and digital parts are closely intermixed, hence demanding AMS design methods and tools to be more holistic. In particular, the emergence of ""little digital"" electronics inside or near analog circuitry calls for the increasing use of asynchronous logic. To cope with the growing complexity of AMS designs, formal methods are required to complement traditional simulation approaches.

Here we introduce a set of active blocking strategies which allow the defender to influence the intruder's actions through exploitation of its obstacle avoidance. By applying a mirror transformation to the intruder's current state, a pursuit policy can be formed that always places the defender between the intruder and the asset. To apply these strategies to delayed or imperfect information environments, we present a model-predictive method of calculating defender motion goals and estimating future intruder motions. This predictive estimator is capable of generating a meta-model for the intruder's behavior and returning a probability distribution of intruder control actions based on a reduced set of observable spatial features."

All rights reserved.Schedules of supply chains are generated with buffers to absorb the effect of disruptive events that could occur during their execution. Schedules can be systematically repaired through specific modifications within buffers by using appropriate decision models that consider the distributed nature of a supply chain. To this aim, information of disruptive events at occurrence or in advance allows decision models to make better decisions. To detect and predict disruptive events along a schedule execution, a service-oriented monitoring subsystem that uses a reference model for defining monitoring models was proposed. This subsystem offers services for collecting execution data of a schedule and environment data, and assessing them to detect/anticipate disruptive events. Because of the distributed nature and the complexity of these services functionalities, this paper presents an agent-based approach for their implementation. This technology allows dealing with supply chain monitoring by structuring monitoring subsystem functionalities as a set of autonomous entities. These entities are able to perform tailored plans created at execution time to concurrently monitor different schedules. A case study is described to try out the implemented prototype system."
Agent-Based Simulation of Offender Mobility: Integrating Activity Nodes from Location-Based Social Networks,Raquel Ros&#233;s and Cristina Kadar and Charlotte Gerritsen and Chris Rouly,AAMAS '18,2018,ACM,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-85054662135,,"© 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved.In recent years, simulation techniques have been applied to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime. Researchers have instantiated mobile offenders in agent-based simulations for theory testing, experimenting with prevention strategies, and crime prediction purposes, despite facing challenges due to the complex dynamics of crime and the lack of detailed information about offender mobility. This paper presents an agent-based model to explore offender mobility, focusing on the interplay between the agent's awareness space and activity nodes. To instantiate a realistic urban environment, we use open data to simulate the urban structure and location-based social networks data to represent activity nodes as proxy for human activity. 18 mobility strategies have been tested, combining search distance strategies (e.g. Levy flight, inspired by insights in human dynamics literature) and destination selection strategies (enriched with Foursquare data). We analyze and compare the different mobility strategies, and show the impact of using activity nodes extracted from social networks to simulate offender mobility. This agent-based model provides a basis for comparing offender mobility in crime simulations by inferring offender mobility in urban areas from real world data."

The aim of our work is to combine these trends, to develop an agent-based system for group-style gasoline price negotiations. Specifically, the proposed system is to reward drivers for (re)fueling (and shopping) at gas stations. Negotiations concerning the reward level are to involve autonomous agents representing cars and stations.

OMG’s Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) provides standards useful for a model-driven software engineering process. Bringing MDA and AOSE together, we propose that building interoperable agents for various existing agent methodologies requires the definition of two things: (1) a core metamodel unifying the basic agent-oriented concepts, and (2) its complementing framework supporting the design, development and execution of agent systems in a model-driven manner. This paper presents a step towards the definition of this framework. For this purpose, we take a given Platform-Independent Model for Service-Oriented Architectures (PIM4SOA) and discuss how service models, designed in accordance with the PIM4SOA can be deployed in agent platforms, such as JACK and JADE, using principles of Model-Driven Development (MDD). Additionally, this provides a foundation for incorporating autonomous agents into different architectures, for example, SOA. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Exposure to the fine particulate matters (PMs) will harm the human health and even cause irreversible damages, in the circumstances of calling for effective monitoring methods. It is necessary to bring in a monitoring platform with sufficient mobility to monitor the places where monitoring stations are not convenient to install. A mobile and portable monitoring platform based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed by combining promoted sensor board and specific communication module in this paper. The monitoring flights are carried out in 30 days with 20 minutes efficient monitoring time for each flight in the ambient airspace around the object region, and the air components contents are gathered orderly to the air sensor board and send to the ground station constantly. The result shows a larger air quality index (AQI) differences exist between the fixed station and UAV monitoring where the AQI sharply changes relatively to the previous day, which signifies a large atmospheric-flow and dynamical change of air component contents. Moreover, the air quality of a dynamic monitored area formed by the further application of UAV-platform will generate critical information to the controlling of indoor air quality for the buildings in the area."

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Increases in poaching levels have led to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) to count animals, locate animals in parks, and even find poachers. Finding poachers is often done at night through the use of long wave thermal infrared cameras mounted on these UAVs. Unfortunately, monitoring the live video stream from the conservation UAVs all night is an arduous task. In order to assist in this monitoring task, new techniques in computer vision have been developed. This work is based on a dataset which took approximately six months to label. However, further improvement in detection and future testing of autonomous flight require not only more labeled training data, but also an environment where algorithms can be safely tested. In order to meet both goals efficiently, we present AirSim-W, a simulation environment that has been designed specifically for the domain of wildlife conservation. This includes (i) creation of an African savanna environment in Unreal Engine, (ii) integration of a new thermal infrared model based on radiometry, (iii) API code expansions to follow objects of interest or fly in zig-zag patterns to generate simulated training data, and (iv) demonstrated detection improvement using simulated data generated by AirSim-W. With these additional simulation features, AirSim-W will be directly useful for wildlife conservation research."

In this paper, we describe the architecture of Aurora and the design considerations leading to that architecture. We believe the central constraint in high throughput data processing has moved from compute and storage to the network. Aurora brings a novel architecture to the relational database to address this constraint, most notably by pushing redo processing to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service, purpose-built for Aurora. We describe how doing so not only reduces network traffic, but also allows for fast crash recovery, failovers to replicas without loss of data, and fault-tolerant, self-healing storage. We then describe how Aurora achieves consensus on durable state across numerous storage nodes using an efficient asynchronous scheme, avoiding expensive and chatty recovery protocols. Finally, having operated Aurora as a production service for over 18 months, we share lessons we have learned from our customers on what modern cloud applications expect from their database tier.

The aim of the present study was to examine the modulating impacts of CUR against cognitive deficits and oxidative damage in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) infused rats. Rats were injected bilaterally with ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg), while sham rats received the same volume of vehicle and then supplemented with CUR (80 mg/kg) for three weeks. After two weeks of ICV-STZ infusion, rats were tested for cognitive performance using passive avoidance and water maze tasks and then sacrificed for biochemical and histopathological assays. ICV-STZ rats showed significant cognitive deficits, which were significantly improved by CUR supplementation. CUR supplementation significantly augmented increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malonaldehyde (MDA), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), protein carbonyl (PC) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG); decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and its dependent enzymes (Glutathione peroxidase [GPx] and glutathione reductase [GR]) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex; and increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus of ICV-STZ rats.

Autonomous follow driving is one of the highly probable application forms of autonomous vehicles in the near future. In this article, we aim at the basic autonomous following form with one follower and one leader. Proper longitudinal regulation of the follower vehicle is essential for the driving quality of the two-vehicle platoon. Focusing on this problem, a novel longitudinal control method composing of a learning-based acceleration decision phase and an internal model–based acceleration tracking phase is proposed for the follower vehicle. In the acceleration decision phase, proper acceleration commands of the follower that adjusts the following distance converging to the target value are determined by a near-optimal acceleration policy which is obtained through an online reinforcement learning algorithm named neural dynamic programming. In the acceleration tracking phase, throttle and brake control commands that drive the vehicle as the decided acceleration are derived by an internal model control structure. The performance of our proposed method is verified by simulation experiments conducted with CarSim, an industry recognized vehicle dynamic simulator."

To introduce scalability and modifiability in future fault-tolerant avionic systems, adaptive mechanisms have to replace the still common manual configuration and parameterization of the middleware. This requires a fundamentally new middleware approach, which is presented in this paper. Adaptivity refers to the autonomous adaption during the initial middleware configuration and has to take domain specific requirements into account, e.g. deterministic communication paths. This is why known concepts from congeneric domains cannot be transferred directly, e.g. PnP from computer science. The publish/subscribe communication paradigm (pub/sub paradigm), with its inherent loose-coupling property serves the ability to interconnect an arbitrary unconfigured system autonomously. The concept of the pub/sub paradigm is applied to the adaptive communication middleware. Alongside the conceptual consideration, the concept is validated on a laboratory demonstrator. The results are promising and the adaptive middleware approach aims to push future avionic systems further towards adaptivity. Further validations should iteratively close the gap towards authorized avionics hardware and for aerospace certified protocols."

Its study faces researchers with important challenges due to its complexity: it involves large numbers of heterogeneous vehicles, with drivers having different skills and attitudes, in a dynamic environment that is both artificial and natural, and subject to complex regulations. To address the study of traffic, researchers have made an intensive use of computer simulations over the last decades. Despite of these efforts, current simulations have still important limitations regarding the holistic study of traffic. They usually focus on some aspects of the phenomenon, disregarding the influence of others. Our work tries to address this problem with a platform for agent-based simulation of traffic. It allows the high-level specification of the environment, the vehicles and the drivers, and their interactions. Then, it adopts a model-driven development to implement these specifications in a given simulation platform. This approach provides flexibility to change the models of the simulation and adopt the target platform best-suited for the experiments at hand. The paper illustrates the approach with the first prototype implemented.

Many of these applications are still in operation. To meet new business demands, new applications that have to collaborate with existing programs need to be developed. It is possible to have an agile software architecture that enables easy development, extension and maintenance in COBOL. Such an architecture, and the agile development process, are presented in this article. The architectural design is a combination of the layered, component-based and service-oriented architectural patterns. It also includes features such as the centralized control of the business process, plug-and-play autonomous COBOL modules and context container for storing state data. A model-driven approach is used in the agile development process. Application models include UML class diagrams, state charts and activity diagrams from which various software artefacts and COBOL codes are generated. The architecture and development approaches were first introduced in 2004 and have been successfully applied to 13 applications since then."

The aim is to verify whether CME-driven shock parameters can be inferred from the analysis of j-maps. For this purpose, we used the SSSEM to derive the CME and the shock kinematics. Arrival times and speeds, inferred assuming either propagation at constant speed or with uniform deceleration, agree well with Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) measurements. The shock standoff distance [Δ], the density compression [(Formula presented.)], and the Mach number [M] were calculated by combining the results obtained for the CME and shock kinematics with models for the shock location. Their values were extrapolated to L1 and compared to in-situ data. The in-situ standoff distance was obtained from ACE solar-wind measurements, and the Mach number and compression ratio were provided by the interplanetary shock database of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. They are (Formula presented.) and M = 2.2. The best fit to observations was obtained when the SSSEM half-width (Formula presented.), and the CME and shock propagate with uniform deceleration. In this case we found (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and M=2.93. The study shows that CME-driven shock parameters can be estimated from the analysis of time–elongation plots and can be used to predict their in-situ values."

This approach has been used by several researchers in order to measure the social processes in collaborative learning experiences. But oftentimes such measures were calculated at the final state of experiences, what may be hardly representative of students' behaviours during the learning processes. Therefore, a temporal dimension in SNA metrics may extend and improve the understanding about students' interactions in a collaborative scenario. In this respect, this paper presents a systematic review about SNA metrics used for analysing CSCL scenarios and proposes to trace the behaviour of such metrics during experiences through the inclusion of a temporal dimension. In order to expose this approach, a real collaborative learning experience, supported by a platform called SMLearning System, was analysed. We found that social relationships among students tend to be symmetric, i.e., there was a proportional distribution of efforts and contributions of students, which is an expected condition in a collaborative scenario. Such observations are based on the temporal behaviour of the reciprocity metric and the correlation between in- and out- degree centrality metrics measured in time."

As a consequence, where functional specifications exist, these are often created unsystematically and are of poor quality, leading to further problems during design, implementation and testing.

In recent years, there has been much research in the communities of context-aware systems and selfadaptive systems with their own foci. However, addressing context awareness and self-adaptation in a consistent and integrated manner remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling and realizing such context-aware adaptive software systems. Our approach explicitly separates but relates the context model and the system model, so that their relationships, changes, and change impacts across the system and its contexts can be clearly captured and managed. In particular, we differentiate management context from operational context as to whether or not context changes cause system adaptation. To enable runtime changes to the system, its contexts, and their relationships, they all have their runtime representation, so that they can be manipulated and managed at runtime. Our component model for realizing the approach directly supports component interface definitions for context and management as well as functionality. Furthermore, we have developed a tool to generate the system implementations from their models and to validate and verify their context-aware adaptive behavior. We demonstrate our approach through the modeling and realization of a context-aware vehicle route planning system. © 2011 IEEE."

In previous research, a relay function was introduced to improve the performance in this system type. However, the relay function was only evaluated using a simple model due to computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a heuristic method for evaluating the relay function, which can simplify the computation. This method can reduce the computational complexity, and the relay function can obtain higher efficiency than direct communication."

These systems have several requirements directly related to their main characteristics, the so-called Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), which refer to orthogonal properties, conditions, and restrictions that are spread out over the entire system. Pure object-oriented methods do not address successfully those so called cross-cutting concerns, so new technologies, like aspect orientation, are applied in order to fulfill this gap. The paper presents DERAF - Distributed Embedded Real-time Aspects Framework, an extensible and high-level framework (i.e. implementation-independent) to handle NFR of DERTS at earlier design stages. DERAF combines the use of aspects with RT-UML, aiming to separate the handling of non-functional from functional requirements in the Model Driven Design of DERTS.

Yet it also offers many productivity, maintainability and performance benefits for platform-specific functions, such as the generation of machine code. We have created reliable assemblers for SPARC™ , AMD64, IA32 and PowerPC which support all user mode and privileged instructions and with 64 bit mode support for all but the latter. These assemblers are generated as Java source code by our extensible assembler framework, which itself is written in the Java language. The assembler generator also produces javadoc comments that precisely specify the legal values for each operand. Our design is based on the Klein Assembler System written in Self. Assemblers are generated from a specification, as are table-driven disassemblers and unit tests. The specifications that drive the generators are expressed as Java language objects. Thus no extra parsers are needed and developers do not need to learn any new syntax to extend the framework for additional ISAs. Every generated assembler is tested against a preexisting assembler by comparing the output of both. Each instruction's test cases are derived from the cross product of its potential operand values. The majority of tests are positive (i.e., result in a legal instruction encoding). The framework also generates negative tests, which are expected to cause an error detection by an assembler. As with the Klein Assembler System, we have found bugs in the external assemblers as well as in ISA reference manuals. Our framework generates tens of millions of tests. For symbolic operands, our tests include all applicable predefined constants. For integral operands, the important boundary values, such as the respective minimum, maximum, 0, 1 and -1, are tested. Full testing can take hours to run but gives us a high degree of confidence regarding correctness. © 2007 *********** Copyright Author/Institution **************."

One of the most important problems within the multi-robot context is path planning. This has been shown to be particularly challenging, as the team of robots must deal with additional constraints, e.g. inter-robot collision avoidance, while searching in a much larger action space. Previous works have proposed solutions to this problem, but they present two major drawbacks: (i) algorithms suffer from a high computational complexity, or (ii) algorithms require a communication link between any two robots within the system. This paper presents a method to solve this problem, which is both computationally efficient and only requires local communication between neighboring agents. We formulate the multi-robot path planning as a distributed constraint optimization problem. Specifically, in our approach the asynchronous distributed constraint optimization algorithm (Adopt) [15] is combined with sampling-based planners to obtain collision free paths, which allows us to take into account both kinematic and kinodynamic constraints of the individual robots. The paper analyzes the performance and scalability of the approach using simulations, and presents real experiments employing a team of several robots."

In order to investigate the impact of these professionals, this work sets out to provide an overview and an evaluation of an e-coaching ecosystem specifically designed for runners. The platform supports and guides people towards an active lifestyle by stimulating their motivation to exercise through the engagement provided by the interactions between users and human trainers. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of the support offered by the human trainers and the engagement of the users. The results show that the support of human qualified trainers is crucial. Users tend to be more engaged to train when their trainings are developed and remotely supervised by a human coach. This has resulted in more workout sessions performed with respect to users exercising by following standard or self-made routines without direct professional supervision. Our findings show that e-coaching systems should develop their coaching protocols always taking into account the effectiveness of the support of qualified professionals over completely automated approaches."

The energy is mainly consumed by data sensing, data transmission and movement of sensors. The energy consumed by data transmission is much larger than data sensing. A potential solution for energy saving is applying the external devices to collect data to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we adopt an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serving as the data mule and propose a novel energy-efficient UAV-based data aggregation protocol in WSNs to reduce the energy consumption of sensors. By considering a clustered WSN, our approach computes an optimal path for data mule through all cluster heads (CHs) while achieving a relatively high system-wide energy efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a genetic algorithm to derive a near-optimal solution for a large-scale WSN while reducing the computing time. We compare our protocol with state-of-the-art approaches, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the network performance on energy efficiency."

Telepresence technology, such as Kubi, can be potentially beneficial for this target population to stay socially connected [1]. However, the Kubi robot is not specifically designed for older adults with mobility impairment. For this target population to adopt the technology successfully, it is important to ensure that they would not experience usability barriers. Thus, we conducted usability testing of Kubi with five older adults with self-reported mobility impairment. The findings indicated both hardware and GUI problematic issues for this population. Hardware problems were primarily related to the base. GUI usability issues were caused by system visibility and control of the robot. These findings provide direction for improving the usability of telepresence robots, particularly for adults aging with mobility impairment."
An Evaluation of the Chandy-Misra-Bryant Algorithm for Digital Logic Simulation,"Soulé, Larry;Gupta, Anoop",ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) - Special issue on parallel and distributed systems performance,1991,ACM,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NO,Exclude,,ar,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS),1991-01-10,10.1145/130611.130613,2-s2.0-84976711937,,"We explore the suitability of the Chandy-Misra-Bryant 1991 algorithm for the domain of digital logic simulation. Our evaluation is based on results for six realistic benchmark circuits, one of them being the R6000 microprocessor form MIPS. A quantitative evaluation of the concurrency exhibited by the CMB algorithm shows that an average of 42-196 element activations can be evaluated in parallel if arbitrarily many processors are available. One major factor limiting the parallel performance is the large number of deadlocks that occur. We present a classification of the types of deadlocks and describe them in terms of circuit structure. Using domain-specific knowledge, we propose and evaluate several methods for both reducing the number of deadlock occurences and for reducing the time spent on each occurence. Running on a 16-processor Encore Multimax we observe speedups of 6-9. While these self-relative speedups are larger than a parallel version of the traditional centralized-time event-driven algorithm, they come at the price of large overheads: significantly more complex element evaluations, extra element evaluations, and deadlock resolution time. These overheads overwhelm the advantages of using distributed time and consistently make the parallel performance of the CMB algorithm about three times slower than that of the traditional parallel event-driven algorithm. Our experience leads us to conclude that the distributed-time CMB algorithm does not present a viable alternative to the centralized-time event-driven algorithm in the domain of parallel digital logic simulation. © 1991, ACM.

One of the most relevant behavior-based models that tries to deal with this problem is the behavior network model proposed by Maes. This model proposes a set of behaviors as purposive perception-action units that are linked in a nonhierarchical network, and whose behavior selection process is orchestrated by spreading activation dynamics. In spite of being an adaptive model (in the sense of self-regulating its own behavior selection process), and despite the fact that several extensions have been proposed in order to improve the original model adaptability, there is not yet a robust model that can self-modify adaptively both the topological structure and the functional purpose of the network as a result of the interaction between the agent and its environment. Thus, this work proposes an innovative hybrid model driven by gene expression programming, which makes two main contributions: (1) given an initial set of meaningless and unconnected units, the evolutionary mechanism is able to build well-defined and robust behavior networks that are adapted and specialized to concrete internal agent's needs and goals; and (2) the same evolutionary mechanism is able to assemble quite complex structures such as deliberative plans (which operate in the long-term) and problem-solving strategies. As a result, several properties of self-organization and adaptability emerged when the proposed model was tested in a robotic environment using a multi-agent platform. © The Author(s) 2011."

In this paper, the focus will be on developing new methods for efficiently managing such large-scale networks composed of homogeneous wireless sensors/devices in urban environments such as homes, hospitals, stores and industrial compounds. Heterogeneous networks were proposed in a comparison with the homogeneous ones. The efficiency of these networks will depend on several optimization parameters such as the redundancy, as well as the percentages of coverage and energy saved. We tested the algorithm using different densities of sensors in the network and different values of tuning parameters for the optimization parameters. Obtained results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than the other greedy algorithm. Moreover, networks with more sensors maintain more redundancy and better percentage of coverage. However, it wastes more energy. The same method will be used for heterogeneous wireless sensors networks where devices have different characteristics and the network acts more efficient."

Generally, users in primary care are expected to provide excellent patient care and record high-quality data. In practice, users must balance sets of priorities regarding care and data. The goal of this study was to understand data quality tradeoffs between timeliness, validity, completeness, and use among primary care users. As a case study, data quality measures and metrics are developed through a focus group session with managers. After calculating and extracting measurements of data quality from six years of historic data, each measure was modeled with logit binomial regression to show correlations, characterize tradeoffs, and investigate data quality interactions. Measures and correlations for completeness, use, and timeliness were calculated for 196,967 patient encounters. Based on the analysis, there was a positive relationship between validity and completeness, and a negative relationship between timeliness and use. Use of data and reductions in entry delay were positively associated with completeness and validity. Our results suggest that if users are not provided with sufficient time to record data as part of their regular workflow, they will prioritize spending available time with patients. As a measurement of a primary care system's effectiveness, the negative correlation between use and timeliness points to a self-reinforcing relationship that provides users with little external value. In the future, additional data can be generated from comparable organizations to test several new hypotheses about primary care users."

Previous studies empirically assessed, on the one hand, the benefits of refactoring in terms of code quality and developers' productivity, and on the other hand, the underlying reasons that push programmers to apply refactoring. Results achieved in the latter investigations indicate that besides personal motivation such as the responsibility concerned with code authorship, refactoring is mainly performed as a consequence of changes in the requirements rather than driven by software quality. However, these findings have been derived by surveying developers, and therefore no software repository study has been carried out to corroborate the achieved findings. To bridge this gap, we provide a quantitative investigation on the relationship between different types of code changes (i.e., Fault Repairing Modification, Feature Introduction Modification, and General Maintenance Modification) and 28 different refactoring types coming from 3 open source projects. Results showed that developers tend to apply a higher number of refactoring operations aimed at improving maintainability and comprehensibility of the source code when fixing bugs. Instead, when new features are implemented, more complex refactoring operations are performed to improve code cohesion. Most of the times, the underlying reasons behind the application of such refactoring operations are represented by the presence of duplicate code or previously introduced self-admitted technical debts."

The goal of this process is to ensure that these systems will operate safely without posing undue risks to the user, the public, or the environment. Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met. Objective In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review. Method We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The SLR builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012. Results We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice. Conclusion The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The language is domain-specific to model the behaviour of biological systems. Nodes of graphs are biochemical components, and undirected edges between them represent biochemical bonds. Also, nodes have a finite number of binding sites, and each of them can be the end-point of an edge leading to (exactly one end-point of) another node. A pair of nodes can be connected by multiple edges, each of them representing a particular bond between the involved biochemical entities. Spontaneous events, corresponding to the biological formation/breakage of bonds, can cause graph reconfigurations. Nodes can be programmed to react to them, and consequently change their own propensity to be involved in further events. The event handling routines coded within nodes are executed in a concurrent fashion. This poses the usual problems related to race conditions, deadlock and the like. Language primitives are tailored to cope with these issues. They ensure, e.g., consistency of reconfigurations: each binding site of every node can be connected at most with one single binding site of another node. This extended abstract describes the rationale behind the peculiarities of the language by showing excerpts of programmed nodes that, together with spontaneous events, can drive relevant reconfigurations of graphs. © 2012 ACM."

However, these actions gather information about the behavior of the software vis-a-vis its design aims. In this work, our analysis of the execution traces of an embedded real-time operating system (RTOS) is rather to model the behavior of the physical system being managed by the software application via the embedded operating system. Hence, for an event-triggered embedded RTOS that controls the behavior of a bespoke system like an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the events in the execution traces of the embedded RTOS is directly linked to the operation of the controlled physical system. Therefore, we hypothesize that the frequency of events (method/function calls) per observation is a useful feature for modeling the behavior of the physical system controlled by the operating system. Furthermore, we tackle the challenge of lack of data that sufficiently captures the possible degree of aberration that may occur in a system. We model augmentation via artificial missingness and imputation in the data we have to generate new cases. We implement missingness using the missing completely at random (MCAR) strategy, and we use the overall single mean imputation method at the imputation stage. This imputation method takes the average of the remaining values in the dataset and replaces missing values with this average. This accretion leads to an imputation-based augmented anomaly detection model that enables us to expand both the training and validation/test data. Expansion of the test data ensures that we reduce the misclassification resulting from the non-parametric nature of the anomalies that may occur on the physical system, while the use of injected data for training helps us to do a stress test on our model. We test our model with traces of a real-time operating system kernel of a UAV, and the results show that the model achieves an improved anomalous trace detection accuracy even under the induced missingness."

Focusing specifically on subsidiary legislation (SL), current drafting workflows fall far short of addressing this vision. Whilst a significant amount of recent research has focused on less technical issues such as the actual definition of open data itself, the case for open data as to its management within a legal context, etc. due to the domain specific nature of producing robust and technically accurate open datasets, little work has been done on techniques for the drafting of legislative resources (in particular SL) as open data.

Our work focusses on three areas of particular importance, (i) observing ongoing practice within the government organisations responsible for the drafting and publication of the aforementioned texts, (ii) understanding the means and methods utilised by local authorities which have been tasked with ensuring that standards of compliance are met within all cases of design and construction, and (iii) reviewing and understanding how construction stakeholders actually execute their activities with respect to the texts in question. The outcome of our study has resulted in a methodology and subsequent production of an intelligent XML authoring workflow model (DROID-SL) for such documents which displays how legal texts of this nature can be better consumed within our society. We demonstrate that by adopting a user-oriented drafting vision, it is possible to produce high quality, user-oriented, linked open datasets which wholly embrace the fast moving area of open legislation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

The objective is to understand what factors influence a designer's creativity and performance in Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM). Inspired by the popular Marshmallow Challenge, this exploratory study proposes a framework in which participants apply their DFAM skills in sketching, CAD modeling, 3D-Printing, and a part testing task. Risk attitudes are assessed through the Engineering Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (E-DOSPERT) scale, and prior experiences are captured by a self-report skills survey. Multiple regression analysis found that the average novelty of the participant's ideas, engineering degree program, and risk seeking preference were statistically significant when predicting the performance of their ideas in AM. This study provides a common framework for AM educators to assess students' understanding and creativity in DFAM, while also identifying student risk attitudes when conducting an engineering design task."

Frame knowledge technique has been used to represent knowledge in many information and expert systems. To simplify the complexity of knowledge representation in fault diagnosis expert system, a novel object-frame knowledge representation approach based on hierarchical model was proposed. In this approach, domain specific knowledge is expressed by combinations of object-frames. An Object-frame is composed by relevant state-object, test-object and rule-object or repair-object. Production rules are used to connect relevant objects' states. General features of object-frame and inference algorithm are introduced. Object-frame based knowledge items are stored in SQL database, inference engine performs the inference operation of knowledge using forward chaining strategy, implements reasoning, finds the cause of faults and gives repair suggestion driven by test data. Inference interpretation completes the task of explanation, which improved the clarity of reasoning. The advantage of this method is that we do not need knowledge representation language support. Experimental results show that the method proposed is effective, which improved the fault diagnosis and maintenance for a meteorological vehicle system. © 2011 IEEE."

We advocate a solution based on arrows, an abstract notion of computation that offers both a succinct representation and an effective implementation. Arrows are ubiquitous in their combinator style that happens to capture both sharing and recursion elegantly. We further relate our arrow-based DSL to a more constrained form of arrows called causal commutative arrows, the normalization of which leads to a staged compilation technique improving ODE performance by orders of magnitude. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

Due to the increasing number of robotic platforms available for commercial use, robotic systems are nowadays being approached by users with different backgrounds, who are often more interested in the robots' high-level capabilities than their technical architecture. Without the right expertise however, using robots is restricted to the capabilities exposed by the platform provider, i.e. they can only be used as end products rather than as development platforms. Our hypothesis is that an ontological representation of the capabilities of robots could make these capabilities more accessible, reducing the complexity of robot programming and enabling non-experts to exploit these systems to a much larger extent. To demonstrate this, an ontology abstracting the capabilities exposed by the most common robotic middleware (ROS) is integrated in a system to allow non-experts to program robots of different types and capabilities without previous knowledge either of the specific robotic platform being considered, or of the intricate systems used in its implementation. Our experiments, in which non-experts users had to configure the system in order to make robots achieve different tasks, show how the efforts required for realizing basic tasks using available robotic platforms can be sensibly reduced through our approach."

In product line engineering, product derivation is concerned with the realization of the variability at the implementation level. However, the majority of research works focuses on instantiating the variants selected in the final product, while the derivation at the architecture level has been poorly explored. As product line engineers often customize the product architecture by hand during the application engineering phase, the derivation and customization processes of the product line architecture (PLA) might be in some cases error-prone. Consequently, in this research we present an Ontology-based product Architecture Derivation (OntoAD) framework which automates the derivation of product-specific architectures from an SPL architecture. Our solution uses a language-independent model to specify the product line architecture and a model-driven engineering approach for architecture derivation activities. We use an ontology formalism to reason about the automatic generation of model-to-model transformation rules based on the selection of features and we illustrate our approach using a voice over IP motivating example. Finally, we report results about scalability and performance regarding the size of the variability model."

The syntax of modelling languages is defined by meta-models, making them essential artefacts. A combination of product line engineering methods and meta-models has been proposed to enable specification of modelling language variants, e.g., to describe a range of systems. However, there is a lack of techniques for ensuring syntactic correctness of all meta-models within a family (including their OCL constraints), and semantic correctness related to properties of individual instances of the different variants. The absence of verification methods at the product-line level can cause synthesis of ill-formed meta-models and problematic feature combinations whose effect at the instance level may go unnoticed. To attack this problem, we propose an approach to lifting both the meta-model syntax checking and the satisfiability checking of properties of individual meta-model instances, to the product-line level. We validate the approach via a prototype tool called Merlin, and report on several experiments that show the advantages of our method w.r.t. an enumerative analysis approach."

It is commonly accepted that a service description should include not only the interface, but also the business protocol supported by the service. The present work focuses on the formalization of an important category of protocols that includes time-related constraints (called timed protocols), and the impact of time on compatibility and replaceability analysis. We formalized the following timing constraints: C-Invoke constraints define time windows within which a service operation can be invoked while M-Invoke constraints define expiration deadlines. We extended techniques for compatibility and replaceability analysis between timed protocols by using a semantic-preserving mapping between timed protocols and timed automata, leading to the identification of a novel class of timed automata, called protocol timed automata (PTA).

This paper presents a framework for evaluating flight strategies of UAVs. Our framework is constructed by integrating, using high-level architecture, Ptolemy, a high level specification tool, and SITL/Ardupilot, a domain specific UAV simulator. It allows to evaluate flight strategies under the presence of uncertainty, such as winds, with a level of confidence by constructing a sufficiently large number of simulations. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by testing two different flight strategies in two scenarios under different wind intensities. We measure the flight quality providing quantitative information about the quality of the tested flight strategy, such as distance traveled, with a confidence of 95% and error of 8%."

Thus, in these cities, the public transportation system is heavily relied on. Conventional public transportation modes such as bus, taxi and subway have been globally deployed over the past century. In the last decade, a new type of public transportation mode, shared bike, emerged in many cities. These shared bikes are deployed by either government-regulated or profit-driven companies and are either station-based or station-less. Nonetheless, all of them are designed to better solve the last-mile problem in densely populated cities as complements to the conventional public transportation system. In this paper, we analyse the public transportation patterns in a densely populated city, Chicago, USA, using comprehensive datasets covering the transportation records on shared bikes, buses, taxis and subways collected over one year’s time. Specifically, we apply self-regulated clustering methods to reveal both the majority transportation patterns and the irregular ones. Other than reporting the autonomously discovered transportation patterns, we also show that our method achieves better clustering performance than the benchmarking methods."

Plants respond and adapt to such stress by altering their cellular metabolism and activating various defense machineries. To understand the molecular basis of stress tolerance in plants, we have developed differential proteomes in a hardy legume, grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.). Five-week-old grasspea seedlings were subjected independently to high salinity, low temperature and abscisic acid treatment for duration of 36 h. The physiological changes of stressed seedlings were monitored, and correlated with the temporal changes of proteome using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Approximately, 400 protein spots were detected in each of the stress proteome with one-fourth showing more than 2-fold differences in expression values. Eighty such proteins were subjected to LC-tandem MS/MS analyses that led to the identification of 48 stress-responsive proteins (SRPs) presumably involved in a variety of functions, including metabolism, signal transduction, protein biogenesis and degradation, and cell defense and rescue. While 33 proteins were responsive to all three treatments, 15 proteins were expressed in stress-specific manner. Further, we explored the possible role of ROS in triggering the stress-induced degradation of large subunit (LSU) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco). These results might help in understanding the spectrum of stress-regulated proteins and the biological processes they control as well as having implications for strategies to improve stress adaptation in plants. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Underwater wireless sensor networks could provide an optimal option, and have recently attracted intensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless, terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been well investigated and solved by many approaches that rely on the electromagnetic/optical transmission techniques. Deploying an applicable underwater wireless sensor network is still a big challenge. Due to critical conditions of the underwater environment (e.g., high pressure, high salinity, limited energy etc), the cost of the underwater sensor is significant. The dense sensor deployment is not applicable in the underwater condition. Therefore, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) becomes an alternative option for implementing underwater surveillance and target detection. In this article, we present a framework to theoretically analyze the target detection probability in the underwater environment by using AUVs. The experimental results further verify our theoretical results."

The efficiency properties of naturally aspirated and downsized turbocharged engines were compared for vehicles with automatic transmissions on the US cycles. The resulting powertrain cycle efficiency model is proportional to the powertrain marginal energy conversion efficiency K, which is also its upper limit. It decreases as the powertrain matching parameters, the displacement-to-mass ratio (D/M) and the gearing ratio (n/V), increase. The inputs are the powertrain fuel consumption, the vehicle road load, and the cycle work requirement. They could be modeled simply with only minor approximations through the use of absolute inputs and outputs, and systematic use of scaling. On the Highway test, conventional automatic transmission vehicles of moderate performance achieve between 25% and 30% powertrain efficiency. On the City test, the efficiency is reduced to 15% to 20% because of the higher fraction of open torque converter launches and power-off operation. Compared to naturally aspirated engines, turbocharged and downsized engines are a trade-off between reduced losses and reduced efficiency. When the losses are comparatively high, as in the City test or in high D/M vehicles, the benefit is substantial. But when the losses are comparatively low, as in the Highway test or in low D/M vehicles, the benefit is small."

One productive approach for probing search space structure is to analyze properties of fitness landscapes; however, this paper argues that ER may require a fresh perspective for landscape analysis, because ER o.en goes beyond the black-box se.ing, i.e. evaluations provide useful information about how robots behave, beyond scalar performance heuristics. Indeed, some ER algorithms explicitly exploit such behavioral information, e.g.To follow gradients of behavioral novelty rather than to climb gradients of increasing performance. .us well-motivated behavior-Aware metrics may aid probing search-space structure in ER. In particular, this paper argues that behavioral conceptions of deception, evolvability, and rarity may help to understand ER landscapes, and seeks to quantify and explore them within a common ER benchmark task. To help this investigation, an expressive but limited encoding is designed, such that the behavior of all possible individuals in the domain can be precomputed.The result is an efficient platform for experimentation that facilitates (1) probing exact quantifications of deception, evolvability, and rarity in the chosen domain, and (2) the ability to efficiently drive search through idealistic ground-Truth measures.The results help develop intuitions and suggest possible new ER algorithms.The hope is that the extensible open-source framework enables quick experimentation and idea generation, aiding brainstorming of new search algorithms and measures."

In Antlab, each request is specified declaratively in linear temporal logic extended with quantifiers over robots. The user does not program robots individually, nor know how many robots are available at any time or the precise state of the robots. The Antlab runtime system manages the set of robots, schedules robots to perform tasks, automatically synthesizes robot motion plans from the task specification, and manages the co-ordinated execution of the plan. We provide a constraint-based formulation for simultaneous task assignment and plan generation for multiple robots working together to satisfy a task specification. In order to scalably handle multiple concurrent tasks, we take a separation of concerns view to plan generation. First, we solve each planning problem in isolation, with an ""ideal world"" hypothesis that says there are no unspecified dynamic obstacles or adversarial environment actions. Second, to deal with imprecisions of the real world, we implement the plans in receding horizon fashion on top of a standard robot navigation stack. The motion planner dynamically detects environment actions or dynamic obstacles from the environment or from other robots and locally corrects the ideal planned path. It triggers a re-planning step dynamically if the current path deviates from the planned path or if planner assumptions are violated. We have implemented Antlab as a C++ and Python library on top of robots running on ROS, using SMT-based and AI planning-based implementations for task and path planning. We evaluated Antlab both in simulation as well as on a set of TurtleBot robots. We demonstrate that it can provide a scalable and robust infrastructure for declarative multi-robot programming."

This cyber-physical integration has provided the smart grid with communication, monitoring, computation, and controlling capabilities to improve its reliability, energy efficiency, and flexibility. A microgrid is a localized and semi-autonomous group of smart energy systems that utilizes the above-mentioned capabilities to drive modern technologies such as electric vehicle charging, home energy management, and smart appliances. Design, upgrading, test, and verification of these microgrids can get too complicated to handle manually. The complexity is due to the wide range of solutions and components that are intended to address the microgrid problems. This article presents a novel Model-Based Design (MBD) methodology to model, co-simulate, design, and optimize microgrid and its multi-level controllers. This methodology helps in the design, optimization, and validation of a microgrid for a specific application. The application rules, requirements, and design-time constraints are met in the designed/optimized microgrid while the implementation cost is minimized. Based on our novel methodology, a design automation, co-simulation, and analysis tool, called GridMAT, is implemented. Our experiments have illustrated that implementing a hierarchical controller reduces the average power consumption by 8% and shifts the peak load for cost saving. Moreover, optimizing the microgrid design using our MBD methodology considering smart controllers has decreased the total implementation cost. Compared to the conventional methodology, the cost decreases by 14% and compared to the MBD methodology where smart controllers are not considered, it decreases by 5%."

Even more so if the device under development is intended for use in critical care facilities such as intensive care units. Especially in this case, safety measures and risk mitigation techniques are implemented using both hardware and software components. Thus applying hardware and software testing approaches in combination is inevitable as well. The increasing utilization of test domain-specific languages (Test DSLs), code generators and keyword-driven interpreters tends to raise the level of abstraction in test development. This approach aims to enhance productivity by generating executable tests from a non-programming language created for describing test cases. A second goal is to increase coverage by generating tests for as many as possible combinations of input values (black box test) or for all reasonable paths of a program flow (white box test). In combination with hardware-supported signal generation and fault injection this can be a very powerful strategy for testing safety-critical embedded devices. This article introduces an example of this strategy - the usage of a keyword-driven testing technique in cooperation with additional test hardware - in the context of an embedded medical device development, all the while emphasizing the benefit of combining different approaches. It discusses the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) testing hardware as well as the application of an in-house developed test box. It also highlights the integration of commercial software - for requirements engineering, test management and continuous integration - with a self-developed testing framework powered by its own keyword-based test DSL. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

However, existing methods and techniques to engineer these systems lack support in their specific and systematic treatment. In this paper, a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) method for the design of AmI systems is introduced to deal with NFRs paying special attention to those particularly related to the features of these kind of systems, namely, unobtrusiveness, context-awareness, and self-adaptativeness. The aim is to enable the semi-automatic derivation of quality software design models from an NFRs specification of the system, with special focus on agent-oriented architectures. To this end, Computation Independent Models (CIM) and transformation techniques between them are defined, as well as an evaluation procedure to be applied, which can help developers to make successful solution decisions satisficing the overall quality properties required for AmI systems, and also specific ones for each particular system.

On the one side, work in autonomic computing focuses on systems that maintain themselves, driven by high-level policies. Such a self-administration relies on the concept of a control loop. The autonomic computing control loop involves an abstract representation of the system to analyze the situation and to adapt it properly. On the other side, models are currently used to ease design of complex distributed systems. Nevertheless, at runtime, models remain useless, because they are decoupled from the running system, which dynamically evolves. Our proposal, named DACAR, introduces models in the control loop. Using adequate models, it is possible to design and execute both the distributed systems and their autonomic policies. The metamodel suggested in this paper mixes both OMG Deployment and Configuration (OMG D&C) specification and the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) metamodels. This paper addresses the different concerns involved in the control loop and focuses on the metamodel concepts that are required to express entities of the control loop.

The objective of Madeira is to apply model-driven approaches to investigate large-scale distribution techniques in network management. So far, the project has concentrated on building a prototype system using the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm. For this one of the major challenges was to provide a model supporting P2P characteristics, such as 1) self-organisation, 2) symmetric communication and 3) distributed control and domain specific concepts for distribution and management as can be found in telecommunications. Our modelling approach had to consider the views of the different participants, such as equipment vendor (Ericsson and Siemens), network operator (BT) and service provider (BT, Telefonica). To minimise the complexity of the model, we have focused on fault and configuration management in a dynamically forming network of transient elements. This paper will explain the complexity of the networks we consider and of the management tasks we have to cover. This can be briefly characterized by comprising a multitude of different, sometimes proprietary, technologies and diverse business models. We will motivate the application of new paradigms, in our case the P2P paradigm, to simplify management for seamless service provision to customers. Based on this, we will provide a case study of how we applied a model-driven approach to capture the complexity of the task and the complexity of the management activities, which ultimately led towards the specification of management information and behaviour of network nodes. The methodology we use is presented in the form of a 'vertical slice', where a logical portion of the project, of limited scope and functionality, is brought from the meta-level right through to the development stage, covering all modelling and architectural work as well as the underlying platform aspects. © 2006 IEEE."

The algorithm uses a vertex splitting operation that relies on the detection of equivalent paths in the MDD. Although the algorithm is quite general, it can be adapted to exploit constraint structure by specializing the equivalence tests for partial assignments to particular constraints. We show how to modify the algorithm in a principled way to obtain an approximate MDD when the exact MDD is too large for practical purposes. This is done by replacing the equivalence test with a constraint-specific measure of distance. We demonstrate the value of the approach for approximate and exact MDD compilation and evaluate its benefits in one of the main MDD application domains, interactive configuration. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Methods: Personalized eHealth services provided independent of time and location have to be based on advanced technical paradigms of mobile, pervasive and autonomous computing, enabling ubiquitous health services. Personalized eHealth systems require a multidisciplinary approach including medicine, informatics, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics and the omics disciplines but also legal and regulatory affairs, administration, security, privacy and ethics, etc. Interoperability between different components of the intended system must be provided through an architecture-centric, model-driven, formalized process. Methods Inf Med 2010; 49: 123-134Results: In order to analyze, design, specify, implement and maintain such an interactive environment impacted by so many different domains, a formal and unified methodology for system analysis and design has been developed and deployed, based on an overall architectural framework. The paper introduces the underlying paradigms, requirements, architectural reference models, modeling and formalization principles as well as development processes for comprehensive service-oriented personalized eHealth interoperability chains, thereby exploiting all interoperability levels up to service interoperability. A special focus is put on ontologies and knowledge representation in the context of eHealth and pHealth solutions. Furthermore, EHR solutions, security requirements, existing and emerging standards, and educational challenges for realizing personalized pHealth are briefly discussed. Conclusion: For personal health, bridging between disciplines including ontology co-ordination is the crucial demand.

The approach is based on a feature model, where a feature describes a distinguishable visible aspect, quality, or characteristic of the realization and constraints are applied to the features. Constraints or invariants describe interdependencies with regard to the resolution of variation points based on the features. The adaptation manager checks these invariants at runtime when computing the application variants. A new UML 2.0 profile has also been developed for modeling self-adaptive applications that contains modeling elements for architectural constraints. The modeling approach approach can effectively filter out infeasible application variants and significantly improve the performance of the adaptation process."

Yampa is an instantiation of FRP as a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell. This paper describes Yampa in detail, and shows how it can be used to program a particular kind of hybrid system: a mobile robot. Because performance is critical in robotic programming, Yampa uses arrows (a generalization of monads) to create a disciplined style of programming with time-varying values that helps ensure that common kinds of time- and space-leaks do not occur. No previous experience with robots is expected of the reader, although a basic understanding of physics and calculus is assumed.

Additionally, in a short period of time, handle robots will be also become essential in daily life. There is an increase in demand for applications for handle robots with software requirements such as reusability, flexibility, and adaptability. Unfortunately, the current lack of standardization of hardware and software platforms hinders the fulfillment of these requirements. Hence, it is necessary to define a methodology that provides guidelines to design, implement, and support at runtime of such types of applications. This work explores the advantages of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) in the design and development of tasks performed by handle robots. Concretely, the authors present the ART2ool (Arm based Robotic Tasks modeling Tool), a MDE framework, which is very useful for application domain experts, because it guides them along the design of the application functionality, abstracting from the emerging techniques. Besides, the proposed framework supports an automatic code generation by Mode to Text transformation techniques for component-based and ROS communication middleware, achieving the requirements mentioned previously."

Self-report data has many benefits – ease of collection, control, and depth of understanding – but also many well-known biases stemming from people’s difficulty remembering prior events or predicting how they might behave, as well as their tendency to shape their answers to a perceived audience. Prior work in fields like public health has focused on measuring these biases and developing effective mitigations; however, there is limited evidence as to whether and how these biases and mitigations apply specifically in a computer-security context. In this work, we systematically compare real-world measurement data to survey results, focusing on an exemplar, well-studied security behavior: software updating. We align field measurements about specific software updates (n=517,932) with survey results in which participants respond to the update messages that were used when those versions were released (n=2,092). This allows us to examine differences in self-reported and observed update speeds, as well as examining self-reported responses to particular message features that may correlate with these results. The results indicate that for the most part, self-reported data varies consistently and systematically with measured data. However, this systematic relationship breaks down when survey respondents are required to notice and act on minor details of experimental manipulations. Our results suggest that many insights from self-report security data can, when used with care, translate to real-world environments; however, insights about specific variations in message texts or other details may be more difficult to assess with surveys."

As the automotive industry has already applied model-driven approaches for some time (usually in the form of Matlab/Simulink) it proves to be a fertile ground to advance assurance methods for the maintainability of model-based systems. In this chapter we describe a two-dimensional quality metamodel and present an instance that defines maintainability for MDSD with Matlab/Simulink and TargetLink.

This flight planning and control has the potential to reduce mission dependence upon preflight assumptions, extend flight duration and endurance, enable long periods of quiet operations and allow for the optimum self-routing of the aircraft. The ADWL wind data is used in real-time to detect atmospheric energy features such as thermals, waves, wind shear and others.

In this study, we have evaluated the efficiency of atorvastatin on brain edema, lipid peroxidation, and ultrastructural changes in TBI animal model. Methods: Modified Feeney method has been used for the trauma model in rats. Only craniectomy for group A and trauma after craniectomy for group B was the procedure for animals. For the trauma, rods weighing 24 g were dropped on a foot plate just over the dura. Atorvastatin (1 mg/kg, IP) was administered to the animals in group C after craniectomy and trauma; but on the other hand, animals in group D received only 0.5 mL PEG as the vehicle. Brains were harvested 24 hours after the trauma for the assays of wet-dry weight, lipid peroxidation level, and ultrastructural investigations. Lipid peroxidation levels, TEM, and UNGS were the investigated parameters. The statistical comparisons between the groups were investigated by 1-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis by Duncan and Dunnett T3 test within the groups at the significance level P = .05. Results: Trauma increased water contents of the brain tissues and lipid peroxidation levels in groups B and D. When compared with the results of group B (brain edema, 84.694% ± 1.510%; lipid peroxidation, 74.932 ± 2.491 nmol/g tissue), atorvastatin (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased brain edema (77.362% ± 1.448%), lipid peroxidation level (58.335 ± 3.980 nmol/g tissue), and UNGS scores in group C (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this descriptive study, the remarkable improvements of atorvastatin on brain edema, lipid peroxidation, and ultrastructural investigations encouraged us for a further dose optimization study. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This allows a plethora of attack combinations. This paper demonstrates how to assess exploitability risks of vehicular on-board networks via automatically generated and analyzed attack graphs. Our stochastic model and algorithm combine all possible attack vectors and consider attacker resources more efficiently than Bayesian networks. We designed and implemented an algorithm that assesses a compilation of real vehicle development documents within only two CPU minutes, using an average of about 100 MB RAM. Our proof of concept “Security Analyzer for Exploitability Risks” (SAlfER) is 200 to 5 000 times faster and 40 to 200 times more memory-efficient than an implementation with UnBBayes1. Our approach aids vehicle development by automatically re-checking the architecture for attack combinations that may have been enabled by mistake and which are not trivial to spot by the human developer. Our approach is intended for and relevant for industrial application. Our research is part of a collaboration with a globally operating automotive manufacturer and is aimed at supporting the security of autonomous, connected, electrified, and shared vehicles."

When the target appears in the field of monitoring area, the multiple attributes of the target can be detected by the model. Then, the system makes the appropriate decision according to the predicted result. The experiments show that the multiple attributes of the target face can be recognized by the model. In particular, whether the target wears a helmet or not can be detected by the monitoring system. Further, the safety of intelligent factory would be improved, reducing the reliance on labor force."

However, managing the resources manually to achieve high performance in such a computing system has proved difficult, time-consuming, error-prone and non-QoS-guaranteed.

This approach is based on a combination of a load balancing strategy and feedback auto-tune stages for global optimal performance. In addition, our control algorithms are able to automatically optimize the control parameters at runtime. The design has been built into a SEDA-based web sever and validated by benchmarking this web server. The experimental results demonstrate that our auto-tune design is able to yield superior adaptation performance for SEDA applications in dynamic working environments, achieving desired performance targets with simple control algorithms and automatic parameter tuning.

Recently, these attacks have evolved from simple flooding at the network layer to targeted, application-specific asymmetric attacks. Because of this trend, existing techniques-which rely primarily on network classification at the edge or core routing devices-are becoming ineffective. Our platform integrates machine learning with fine-grained application-level performance metrics and monitoring statistics at the software's components to achieve precise traffic classification for detecting application-specific attacks in real time. When an attack is detected, the platform will then automatically isolate suspicious traffic by routing it to separate component instances with a fixed resource reservation, thus preventing it from interfering with the rest of the system. Our evaluation using a range of asymmetric attacks shows that our detection technique is highly effective and that the close-loop integration of real-time detection and traffic isolation can deliver substantially better quality-of-service for good users in the presence of attacks than the default mitigation using dynamic scaling of resource alone."

However, testing mobile apps is particularly expensive and tedious, often requiring substantial manual effort. While researchers have made much progress in automated testing of mobile apps during recent years, a key problem that remains largely untracked is the classic oracle problem, i.e., to determine the correctness of test executions. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate test cases, that include test oracles, for mobile apps. The foundation for our approach is a comprehensive study that we conducted of real defects in mobile apps. Our key insight, from this study, is that there is a class of features that we term user-interaction features, which is implicated in a significant fraction of bugs and for which oracles can be constructed - in an application agnostic manner - based on our common understanding of how apps behave. We present an extensible framework that supports such domain specific, yet application agnostic, test oracles, and allows generation of test sequences that leverage these oracles. Our tool embodies our approach for generating test cases that include oracles. Experimental results using 6 Android apps show the effectiveness of our tool in finding potentially serious bugs, while generating compact test suites for user-interaction features. © 2014 IEEE."

The solution describes self-reconfiguration as a planning problem that can be tackled by an automated planner. In addition to the usage of the advanced domain-independent search heuristics within the planner, we introduce domain-specific heuristics into the domain description on a higher conceptual level. An explicit optimality measure is part of the given domain description. The planner can cope with difficult self-reconfigurations, e.g. involving building helper organisms. The abstract symbolic plan is executed by a behavior based robot controller, where each robot is seen as an agent that has access to local information only. The position which a robot takes in the final configuration is determined by swarm mechanisms during runtime. A coordination instance broadly monitors the self-reconfiguration. The feasibility and advantages of this approach compared to previous work on self-reconfiguration of MMRs is shown by planning and executing self-reconfiguration in simulation for several organism families with different reconfiguration complexities. © 2013 IEEE."

However, most of these applications are implemented ad-hoc. They are very tied to the programming level reducing thus their reusability, configurability and maintainability. In this setting, we propose a Model-Driven approach to develop video-surveillance applications. This approach is based on the utilization of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that allows the design of these applications at the modeling level. The utilization of models enhance the reusability of the services provided by the systems but also aims at managing their variability making them highly configurable. The models built based on this DSL are then used by model transformations that are able to automatically generate the configuration of the applications so that they may be dynamically reconfigured. Moreover, the approach provides different versions of the system, namely a standalone application, a web application or an application for mobile devices. All these applications allow the remote control of the video installation and the integration of external services such as SMS alerts, vehicles' plate recognition or smart home control."

All rights reserved.Clinical guidelines and protocols (CGPs) are standard documents with the aim of helping practitioners in their daily work. Their computerization has received much attention in recent years, but it still presents some problems, mainly due to the low sustainability and low adaptability to changes (both in knowledge and technology) of the computerized CGPs. This paper presents an approach to an easy and automatic creation of Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs), which are suitable for the computerized interpretation of differential diagnoses. The proposed FIS development process is based on applying Model-Driven Software Engineering techniques: automatic generation of computer artefacts and separation of concerns. The process focuses on the separation of roles during the design stage: domain experts use a basic editor that allows them to define the categories and factors that will be involved in the FIS in natural language, while knowledge engineers at a later stage refine these elements using a more advanced editor. The whole system has been tested by automatically generating two FISs that have been included in a computerized CGP for the diagnosis of a rare disease called hyperammonemia. This CGP has been validated and it is currently in use."

The motivation for this work is to accompany mobile-based self-management of chronic pain as a virtual sensor for tracking patients' expressions in real-world settings. Operating under such constraints requires a resource efficient approach for processing non-posed facial expressions from unprocessed temporal data. In this work, the facial action units of pain are modeled as sets of distances among related facial landmarks. Using standardized measurements of pain versus no-pain that are specific to each user, changes in the extracted features in relation to pain are detected. The activated features in each frame are combined using an adapted form of the Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity scale (PSPI) to detect the presence of pain per frame. Painful features must be activated in N consequent frames (time window) to indicate the presence of pain in a session. The discussed method was tested on 171 video sessions for 19 subjects from the McMaster painful dataset for spontaneous facial expressions. The results show higher precision than coverage in detecting sequences of pain. Our algorithm achieves 94% precision (F-score=0.82) against human observed labels, 74% precision (F-score=0.62) against automatically generated pain intensities and 100% precision (F-score=0.67) against self-reported pain intensities."

Then, it emerges the need for software engineering techniques supporting the definition, development, and realization of missions involving swarms of autonomous drones while guaranteeing the safety today's users expect. In this paper we consider mission specifications expressed through a domainspecific modeling language which can be effectively used by endusers with no technical expertise, e.g., firefighters and rescue workers. Our generation method automatically derives the lower level logic that each drone must perform to accomplish the specified mission, prevents collisions between drones and obstacles, and ensures the preservation of no-fly zones."

The modeling phase uses the SysML graphical modeling language. The prepared model is analyzed by the dedicated mechanism, which creates the ordered list of operations that should be performed in the implementation.

The populating of the database is usually done in a manual fashion by row and column as the data become available, and the data dictionary is usually defined by the same team (at times with little input from the end science user). This process is tedious, error prone and self-limiting in terms of what can be described in a relational Data Base Management System (DBMS). The next generation Earth remote sensing platforms [i.e., Earth Observing System (EOS)] will be capable of generating data at a rate of over 300 Megabits per second from a suite of instruments designed for different applications. What is needed is an innovative approach that creates object-oriented data-bases that segment, characterize, and catalog, and are manageable in a domain-specific context, and whose contents are available interactively and in near-real-time to the user community. This paper describes work in progress that utilizes an artificial neural net approach to characterize satellite imagery of undefined objects into high-level data objects.

To facilitate monitoring, governance, and self-adaptation the information in these models can be used by services that monitor, manage, or adapt the SOA at runtime. If a service for monitoring, management, or adaptation in an SOA is dependent on models, and the metamodel changes, usually the service needs to be manually adapted to work with the new version, recompiled, and redeployed. This manual effort impedes the use of models at runtime. To address this problem, this paper introduces model-aware services that work with models at runtime. These services are supported using a service environment, called Morse. Hiding the complexity of implicit versioning of models from users while respecting the principle of Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs), it realizes a novel transparent UUID-based model versioning technique. It uses the model-driven approach to automatically generate and deploy Morse services that are used by the model-aware services to access models in the correct version. In this way, monitoring and adaptation in SOAs can be better supported, and the manual effort to evolve services for monitoring, management, or adaptation, which are based on models at runtime, can be minimized. © 2012 IEEE."

This research direction is of interest for many applications that, on the one hand, have strong reconfiguration requirements to manage mobility, ubiquity, adaptation and self-healing, which are essential for autonomy, and that, on the other hand, are subject to non-functional constraints of quality of service, robustness and reliability.

We present a navigation-by-reconstruction approach to address this question, where moving paths of the robot are planned to account for both global efficiency for fast exploration and local smoothness to obtain high-quality scans. An RGB-D camera, attached to the robot arm, is dictated by the desired reconstruction quality as well as the movement of the robot itself. Our key idea is to harness a time-varying tensor field to guide robot movement, and then solve for 3D camera control under the constraint of the 2D robot moving path. The tensor field is updated in real time, conforming to the progressively reconstructed scene. We show that tensor fields are well suited for guiding autonomous scanning for two reasons: first, they contain sparse and controllable singularities that allow generating a locally smooth robot path, and second, their topological structure can be used for globally efficient path routing within a partially reconstructed scene. We have conducted numerous tests with a mobile robot, and demonstrate that our method leads to a smooth exploration and high-quality reconstruction of unknown indoor scenes."

In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that the number of deaths from traffic accidents in the USA increased by 7% from 2014 to 2015, rising to 35,092 fatalities [4]. Amid growing humanitarian concerns of so many injuries and fatalities worldwide, the Department of Transport issued a call to action encouraging the continuous research into different approaches that can improve the situation. As such, there are various research studies which are geared towards how in-vehicle systems can encourage drivers to adapt their driving behaviour and help to reduce the amount of both fatal and non-fatal traffic accidents. Typically, these systems aim to prevent a collision with an upcoming vehicle or pedestrian by providing warnings to drivers, and latest studies demonstrate promising evidence that these systems can indeed have significant positive effects [2, 9,10]. However, the vast majority of studies have focused on simulation experiments [3, 8] and controlled lab experiments [6, 13]. We have recently contributed to this field by bringing an in-vehicle warning system into a field studying setting, utilising real world location analytics on traffic accident hotspots to generate in-vehicle warnings [7]. Going one step further, the benefit of ubiquitously detecting dangerous locations from data gathered by connected vehicles, and and using these locations as a source for in-vehicle warnings, has widely not been addressed in this growing domain and is the focus of our research."

In this paper, we propose AVIDA-MDE, a digital evolution approach to the generation of behavioral models (i.e., a set of interacting finite state machines) that capture autonomic system behavior that is potentially resilient to a variety of environmental conditions. We use an evolving population of digital organisms to generate behavioral models, where the organisms are subjected to natural selection and are rewarded for generating behavioral models that meet developer requirements. To illustrate this approach, we successfully applied it to the generation of behavioral models describing the navigation behavior of an autonomous robot. Copyright 2008 ACM."

On the one hand, self-driving cars present new engineering problems that are being gradually successfully solved. On the other hand, social and ethical problems have up to now being presented in the form of an idealized unsolvable decision-making problem, the so-called ""trolley problem"", which is built on the assumptions that are neither technically nor ethically justifiable. The intrinsic unfairness of the trolley problem comes from the assumption that lives of different people have different values. In this paper, techno-social arguments are used to show the infeasibility of the trolley problem when addressing the ethics of self-driving cars. We argue that different components can contribute to an ""unfair"" behaviour and features, which requires ethical analysis on multiple levels and stages of the development process. Instead of an idealized and intrinsically unfair thought experiment, we present real-life techno-social challenges relevant for the domain of software fairness in the context of self-driving cars."

An integrated model based on the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response approach was developed as a tool to assess the effects of policies for improving decision making for the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. An economic model was linked to a process-based biophysical model by a meta-model. Then, a holistic indicator-based impact assessment system was linked to the integrated model to assess policy instruments. The integrated model was applied in the intensive irrigated wheat-maize cropping system of the North China Plain in which water and nitrogen fertilizer management are known to be critical issues for sustainable resource management. The results show there is a trade-off relationship between economic return and environmental outcome. It was shown that water pricing is a more effective policy instrument for improving the sustainability of agro-ecosystem than increasing the price of nitrogen fertilizer. When the water price is raised to 1.0 Yuan/m3 under a two-tariff system, the sustainability indicators for the irrigation water use efficiency was found to increase from 0.37 to 0.77, groundwater use sustainability increased from 0.05 to 0.60, nitrate leaching increased from 0.48 to 0.55 while the indicators for the farm gross margin, food self-sufficiency, and soil nitrogen balance remain unchanged. The results suggest the modeling approach developed here is very useful for evaluating policy options for complex natural resource management issues. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In our study, we used current biomedical approaches to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BXD and possible protective mechanism involved in inhibiting dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic ulcerative colitis model. Materials and methods Chronic DSS colitis was induced in C57BL/6 male mice by three cycles of 5 days of 2% DSS in drinking water, alternating with 5 days of normal water, totaling 30 days. In BXD group, the mice were administered at a dose of 8.7 g/kg BXD for 5 days before and during DSS treatment via oral gavage per day. Mice in vehicle group and DSS group were given orally the same volume of drinking water, instead. Body weight, stool characters and hematochezia were observed everyday. The colorectal tissues were used to detect levels of TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23 and MPO by ELISA or qRT-PCR. The expression of COX-2, 8-Oxoguanine and Nrf2 were examined by IHC, and p-p65 was examined by western blotting. ThOD and the content of MDA were measured according to kits respectively. Results BXD significantly protected against DSS-induced chronic ulcerative colitis by amelioration of body weight loss, DAI and histology score. The level of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, COX-2 and p-p65 were decreased significantly, while the level of IL-10 improved with the treatment of BXD. MDA, MPO and 8-Oxoguanine were decreased, meanwhile SOD activity and Nrf2 expression were elevated significantly by BXD. Conclusions BXD possesses the potential of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation to treat colitis. The protective mechanism of BXD may involve in inhibition of NF-κBp65 activation and increasement of Nrf2 expression in colorectums of mice."

The agents used in such simulations rarely capture the real-world decision-making of human beings. An absence of realistic agent behavior can undermine the reliability of insights generated by such simulations and might make them ill-suited for informing public health policies. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a methodology to create and calibrate an agent decision making model for a large multiagent simulation, using survey data. Our method optimizes a cost vector associated with the various behaviors to match the behavior distributions observed in a detailed survey of human behaviors during influenza outbreaks. Our approach is a data-driven way of incorporating decision making for agents in large-scale epidemic simulations."

This paper describes behavioral models based on the describing function method and Bessel series expansion of nonlinear modulations. Models have been derived for the self-oscillation, the bandwidth, the dominant third-order distortion and all inter-modulation products of a SOPA line driver. All spectral peaks at the output of a single ended SOPA amplifier are qualitatively and quantitatively explained by these models with a very high accuracy.

This management is performed based on past monitoring events, configurations as well as behavioural programs defining the adaptation logics and invariant properties. The challenge here is to provide assurances on navigation through the configuration space, which requires taking decisions that involve predictions on possible futures of the system. This paper proposes the design of AMs based on logical discrete control approaches, where the use of behavioural models enriches the manager with a knowledge not only on events, states and past history, but also with possible future configurations. We define a Domain Specific Language, named Ctrl-F, which provides high-level constructs to describe behavioural programs in the context of software components. The formal definition of Ctrl-F is given by translation to Finite State Automata, which allow for the exploration of behavioural programs by verification or Discrete Controller Synthesis, automatically generating a controller enforcing correct behaviours. We implement an AM by integrating the result of Ctrl-F compilation and validate it with an adaptation scenario over Znn.com, a self-adaptive case study."

In this approach, each time an agent generates a new intersection schedule it communicates its expected outflows to its downstream neighbors as a prediction of future demand and these outflows are appended to the downstream agent's locally perceived demand. In this paper, we extend this basic coordination protocol to additionally incorporate the complementary flow of information reflective of an intersection's current congestion level to its upstream neighbors. We present an asynchronous decentralized algorithm for updating intersection schedules and congestion level estimates based on these bi-directional information flows. By relating this algorithm to the self-optimized decision making of the basic protocol, we are able to approach networkwide optimality and reduce inefficiency due to myopic intersection control decisions."

The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) controls the coordinated expression of the important antioxidant and detoxification genes through a promotor sequence termed the antioxidant response element. Bicyclol has been proved to elicit a variety of biological effects through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. But the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, the role of bicyclol in cerebral ischemia and its potential mechanism were investigated. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion), Vehicle (MCAO. +. 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose), By-L (Vehicle. +. bicyclol 50. mg/kg), By-H (Vehicle. +. bicyclol 100. mg/kg) and Sham operated groups. Bicyclol was administered intragastrically once a day for 3 consecutive days; after 1. h of bicyclol pretreatment on the third day, rat ischemic stroke was induced by MCAO. Neurological deficit, infarct volume, and brain edema were detected at 24. h after stroke. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to measure the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD1. MDA was detected by the spectrophotometer. Results: Compared with MCAO group, By-H group significantly ameliorated neurological deficit, lessened the infarct volume and brain edema, increased the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD1 (P< 0.05), and decreased the content of MDA (P< 0.05). Conclusions: Bicyclol protected the rat brain from ischemic damage caused by MCAO, and this effect may be through the upregulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 expression. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

In this paper, we analyze dynamic properties of a simple walking model of a biped robot driven by a rhythmic signal from an oscillator. In particular, we examine the long-term global behavior and the bifurcation of the motion that leads to chaotic motion, depending on the model parameter values. The simple model consists of a hip and two legs connected at the hip through a rotational joint. The joint is driven by a rhythmic signal from an oscillator, which is an open loop. In order to analyze the bifurcation, we first obtained approximate solutions of the walking motion and then constructed discrete dynamics using the Poincaré map. As a result, we found that consecutive period-doubling bifurcations occur as the model parameter values change, and that the walking motion leads to chaotic motion over the critical value of the model parameters. Moreover, we approximately obtained the period-doubling solutions and the critical value by employing a Newton-Raphson method. Our analytical results were verified by the numerical simulations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Bipolar II with and without cyclothymic temperament: “dark” and “sunny” expressions of soft bipolarity,"Akiskal, Hagop S.;Hantouche, Elie G.;Allilaire, Jean François",Journal of Affective Disorders,2003,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Journal of Affective Disorders,2003-01-01,10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00320-8,2-s2.0-0037221791,,"Background: In the present report deriving from the French national multi-site EPIDEP study, we focus on the characteristics of Bipolar II (BP-II), divided on the basis of cyclothymic temperament (CT). In our companion article (Hantouche et al., 2003, this issue), we found that this temperament in its self-rated version correlated significantly with hypomanic behavior of a risk-taking nature. Our aim in the present analyses is to further test the hypothesis that such patients - assigned to CT on the basis of clinical interview - represent a more ""unstable"" variant of BP-II. Methods: From a total major depressive population of 537 psychiatric patients, 493 were re-examined on average a month later; after excluding 256 DSM-IV MDD and 41 with history of mania, the remaining 196 were placed in the BP-II spectrum. As mounting international evidence indicates that hypomania associated with antidepressants belongs to this spectrum, such association per se did not constitute a ground for exclusion. CT was assessed by clinicians using a semi-structured interview based on Akiskal and Mallya (1987) in its French version; as two files did not contain full interview data on CT, the critical clinical variable in the present analyses, this left us with an analysis sample of 194 BP-II. Socio-demographic, psychometric, clinical, familial and historical parameters were compared between BP-II subdivided by CT. Psychometric measures included self-rated CT and hypomania scales, as well as Hamilton and Rosenthal scales for depression. Results: BP-II cases categorically assigned to CT (n=74) versus those without CT (n=120), were differentiated as follows: (1) younger age at onset (P=0.005) and age at seeking help (P=0.05); (2) higher scores on HAM-D (P=0.03) and Rosenthal (atypical depressive) scale (P=0.007); (3) longer delay between onset of illness and recognition of bipolarity (P=0.0002); (4) higher rate of psychiatric comorbidity (P=0.04); (5) different profiles on axis II (i.e., more histrionic, passive-aggressive and less obsessive-compulsive personality disorders). Family history for depressive and bipolar disorders did not significantly distinguish the two groups; however, chronic affective syndromes were significantly higher in BP-II with CT. Finally, cyclothymic BP-II scored significantly much higher on irritable-risk-taking than ""classic"" driven-euphoric items of hypomania. Conclusion: Depressions arising from a cyclothymic temperament - even when meeting full criteria for hypomania - are likely to be misdiagnosed as personality disorders. Their high familial load for affective disorders (including that for bipolar disorder) validate the bipolar nature of these ""cyclothymic depressions."" Our data support their inclusion as a more ""unstable"" variant of BP-II, which we have elsewhere termed ""BP-II 1/2."" These patients can best be characterized as the ""darker"" expression of the more prototypical ""sunny"" BP-II phenotype. Coupled with the data from our companion paper (Hantouche et al., 2003, this issue), the present findings indicate that screening for cyclothymia in major depressive patients represents a viable approach for detecting a bipolar subtype that could otherwise be mistaken for an erratic personality disorder. Overall, our findings support recent international consensus in favoring the diagnosis of cyclothymic and bipolar II disorders over erratic and borderline personality disorders when criteria for both sets of disorders are concurrently met. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

GPUS are the dominant computing platform for research efforts and are also gaining popularity as a deployment platform for applications such as autonomous vehicles. As a result, GPU vendors such as NVIDIA have spent enormous effort to write special-purpose NN libraries. On other hardware targets, especially mobile GPUS, such vendor libraries are not generally available. Thus, the development of portable, open, high-performance, energy-efficient GPU code for NN operations would enable broader deployment of NN-based algorithms. A root problem is that high efficiency GPU programming suffers from high complexity, low productivity, and low portability. To address this, this work presents a framework to enable productive, high-efficiency GPU programming for NN computations across hardware platforms and programming models. In particular, the framework provides specific support for metaprogramming and autotuning of operations over ND-Arrays. To show the correctness and value of our framework and approach, we implement a selection of NN operations, covering the core operations needed for deploying three common image-processing neural networks. We target three different hardware platforms: NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm GPUS. On NVIDIA GPUS, we show both portability between OpenCL and CUDA as well competitive performance compared to the vendor library. On Qualcomm GPUS, we show that our framework enables productive development of target-speci?c optimizations, and achieves reasonable absolute performance. Finally, On AMD GPUS, we show initial results that indicate our framework can yield reasonable performance on a new platform with minimal effort."

However, these models are based on computationallyi ntensive calculations of expected utilities. We propose a framework of bounded rationality for voters situated in social networks. Using this framework, we propose and test a number of heuristics that reduce the computation required for optimal strategic reasoning by several orders of magnitude compared to previous work, while retaining similar qualitative behaviors. These heuristics enable us to conduct simulations on how the size of the voting population affects strategic behavior. To illustrate the effectiveness of our app roach, we apply our heuristics to explore the Micromega rule - an observation in political science that large political parties favor small assemblies. We find that the size of electoral districts is a contributing factor to the Micromega rule in some networks. Fringe candidates retain more support in smaller districts, while larger parties dominate in larger districts."

An online survey on brand communities were employed to test the hypotheses derived from the research model. Partial Least Square Regression Analysis (PLS) approach is used to validate the measures and test hypotheses. Results indicated that highly-engaged customers tend to participate in co-creation activities and customer citizenship behaviors. In addition, feelings of brand community engagement are enhanced by customers' brand-self connection and perceived relatedness. And perceived relatedness is most important in predicting brand community engagement among the four antecedents. We draw on these findings to offer implications for researchers and practitioners."

These models play a fundamental role in different types of critical semantic interoperability tasks. Therefore, it is essential that domain experts are able to understand and reason using the models' content. In other words, it is important that conceptual models are cognitively tractable. However, it is unavoidable that when the information of the represented domain grows, so does the size and complexity of the artifacts and models that represent them. For this reason, more sophisticated techniques for complexity management in ontology-driven conceptual models, need to be developed. Some approaches are based on the notion of model modularization. In this paper, we follow the work on model modularization to present an approach for view extraction for the ontology-driven conceptual modeling language OntoUML.

Through in-lab simulator studies, we demonstrate the feasibility of using haptic guidance to increase breathing rate, intensity, and heart rate as well as subjective perceptions of alertness and focus. We also assess usability and user receptivity towards the approach across various simulated driving scenarios (highway, city), times of day (day, night), and traffic levels (low, heavy, fast). In doing so, we outline specific use cases where fast breathing interventions are more or less appropriate and beneficial (e.g., during long, monotonous drives on the highway or at night vs. complex or tense driving sce-narios), and we offer fertile future directions for the continued development of breathing systems for health and well-being."

The goal is to create an integrated workflow tool chain to facilitate integration of various subsystems and verification of the overall system performance to meet a set of desired system requirements. This paper describes an implementation in a model-based representation that encompasses real system hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) components to verify the effectiveness and capability of the development platform. Discussion is provided on the developed model transformation processes that make this possible and is explained through the application of our approach to the development of subsystems for a vehicle system. The key contributions of research include: 1) identification of a suitable model-based systems design methodology and toolset (based on IBM Rhapsody/Mathworks Simulink combination) to include HIL for system verification; 2) design and development of model transformation tools to facilitate bidirectional transformation of an IBM Rhapsody model to a Simulink model; and 3) successful mapping between platform independent models and platform-specific models involving HIL. The research outcomes show particularly promising results that are anticipated to benefit the MBSE community. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

The user-centered view which prevails in the HCI and the device-centered view which is dominant in the mobile and ubiquitous computing. Despite existing advances, context modeling and user interface (UI) design methods are still poorly integrated, making it difficult to use the contextual elements directly in UI design. This paper focuses on bringing user-related aspects of the interaction context in UI design. We propose a model-driven framework for the development of adaptive user interfaces. The framework describes the interaction context by integrating contextual factors from different context perspectives in a unison manner. Then it provides formal semantic relations between contextual and UI elements. The framework has been used in the data visualization domain, particularly in the design of the software instrument table for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that takes into account user context, namely human perceptual abilities."

We assume that each agent has a static home base. To improve connectivity, each agent is allowed to move away from his home base, but only for a limited distance which may be different for different agents. These distances might be dictated by limited batteries of the agents, which forces them to return to their home charging station after a while. An application currently widely considered in literature (and in projects and applications) is disaster management, where helpers are equipped with smartphones to submit important local information to a coordinating station. In case of the network being disconnected, mobile “postmen” are used for long distance connections. In this paper, we focus on the aspect of “communication by postmen”. We model such a scenario by a weighted directed graph. It consists of n (static) nodes describing the home bases of the agents. A directed edge from basevi to basevj with weightw(vi,vj) indicates that agent ai can walk from his home base to the home base of aj, which needs time w(vi,vj). If agent aj is at home when agent ai arrives, they can exchange messages. Alongside with the introduction of the model, we present a randomized distributed algorithm for all-to-all message dissemination and show that its performance is, in many cases, close to optimal."

We assume obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if a third robot is positioned between them on the straight line connecting them. We provide the first O(N) time algorithm for this problem in the fully synchronous setting. Our contribution is a significant improvement over the runtime of the only previously known algorithm for this problem which has a lower bound of Ω(N2).

Scheduling algorithms are crucial in enabling the efficient automation of these large-scale workflows, and considerable effort has been made to develop novel heuristics tailored for the cloud resource model. The majority of these algorithms focus on coarse-grained billing periods that are much larger than the average execution time of individual tasks. Instead, our work focuses on emerging finer-grained pricing schemes (e.g., per-minute billing) that provide users with more flexibility and the ability to reduce the inherent wastage that results from coarser-grained ones. We propose a scheduling algorithm whose objective is to optimize a workflow's execution time under a budget constraint; quality of service requirement that has been overlooked in favor of optimizing cost under a deadline constraint. Our proposal addresses fundamental challenges of clouds such as resource elasticity, abundance, and heterogeneity, as well as resource performance variation and virtual machine provisioning delays. The simulation results demonstrate our algorithm's responsiveness to environmental uncertainties and its ability to generate high-quality schedules that comply with the budget constraint while achieving faster execution times when compared to state-ofthe- art algorithms."

They allow to compute optimal sequences of actions in order to achieve a given goal, accounting for actuator uncertainties. But algorithms classically used to solve MDPs are intractable for problems requiring a large state space. Plans are computed considering the whole state space, without using any knowledge about the initial state of the problem. We propose a new technique to build partial plans for a mobile robot, considering only a restricted MDP which contains a small set of states composing a path between the initial state and the goal state. To ensure good quality of the solution, the path has to be very similar to the one which would have been computed on the whole environment. We present a new method to compute partial plans, showing that representing the environment as a directed graph can be very helpful to find near-optimal paths. Partial plans obtained using this method are very similar to complete plans, and computing times are considerably reduced."

Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models."

However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results but suffer from (1) needing minutes to perform online correction, preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation, resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real time, supports robust trackingwith recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real time to ensure global consistency, all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results."

They have approached this problem from the point of view of coordination: the definitions of interoperability are couched in terms of process-algebraic notions of liveness, fairness, choice, and deadlock-freedom of the components [1, 3, 7]. Such formalizations are no doubt relevant and essential; however, they do not capture the business semantics of business processes. Our commitment-based approach addresses this shortcoming. It abstracts away from the process-algebraic notions of interoperability, and makes commitment alignment the sole criterion. Our vision is that designers first specify agents in terms of commitments, check for commitment alignment, and then successively refine the specifications in a model-driven manner so as to obtain implementations that also meet the process-algebraic notions of interoperability. Our expected contributions in this dissertation are threefold: A high-level definition of interoperability that takes into account the business meanings of communication. Distinction between kinds of interoperability - constitutive and regulative - and decisions procedures for each. A decision procedure for determining conformance. Conformance goes hand in hand with interoperability: replacing an agent specification with a conformant one preserves interoperability. Preliminary results have appeared in [2]. Much works remains to be done. In particular, decision procedures for regulative interoperability and conformance are yet to be devised. In addition, multiparty scenarios need to be adequately addressed. Copyright © 2008, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems(www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved."

This paradigm lends itself to implementations that can provide high throughput and low latency by taking advantage of various forms of parallelism that are naturally captured by the stream processing model of computation, such as pipeline, task, and data parallelism. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of C-Stream, which is an elastic stream processing engine. C-Stream encompasses three unique properties. First, in contrast to the widely adopted event-based interface for developing streaming operators, C-Stream provides an interface wherein each operator has its own driver loop and relies on data availability application programming interfaces (APIs) to decide when to perform its computations. This self-control-based model significantly simplifies the development of operators that require multiport synchronization. Second, C-Stream contains a dynamic scheduler that manages the multithreaded execution of the operators. The scheduler, which is customizable via plug-ins, enables the execution of the operators as co-routines, using any number of threads. The base scheduler implements back-pressure, provides data availability APIs, and manages preemption and termination handling. Last, C-Stream varies the degree of parallelism to resolve bottlenecks by both dynamically changing the number of threads used to execute an application and adjusting the number of replicas of data-parallel operators.We provide an experimental evaluation of C-Stream. The results show that C-Stream is scalable, highly customizable, and can resolve bottlenecks by dynamically adjusting the level of data parallelism used."

Communicating imagery and full-resolution sensor readings to surface observers remains a significant challenge. Yet, without access to the data acquired by an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), surface operators cannot fully understand the mission state of a vehicle. This paper presents an architecture capable of multihop communication across a network of underwater acoustic relays. In concert with an abstracted physical layer, CAPTURE provides an end-to-end networking solution for communicating science data from autonomous marine vehicles. Automatically selected imagery, SONAR, and time-series sensor data are progressively transmitted across multiple hops to surface operators. To incorporate human feedback, data are transmitted as a sequence of gradually improving data 'previews.'

The goal of this work is to investigate a trustworthy, continuous, and non-contact user authentication approach based on a heart-related bio-metric that works in a daily-life environment. To this end, we present a novel, continuous authentication system, namely Cardiac Scan, based on geometric and non-volitional features of the cardiac motion. Cardiac motion is an automatic heart deformation caused by self-excitement of the cardiac muscle, which is unique to each user and is difficult (if not impossible) to counterfeit. Cardiac Scan features intrinsic liveness detection, unobtrusiveness, cost-effectiveness, and high usability. We prototype a remote, highresolution cardiac motion sensing system based on the smart DC-coupled continuous-wave radar. Fiducial-based invariant identity descriptors of cardiac motion are extracted after the radar signal demodulation. We conduct a pilot study with 78 subjects to evaluate Cardiac Scan in accuracy, authentication time, permanence, evaluation in complex conditions, and vulnerability.

Cardioprotective effect of Aralia elata polysaccharide on myocardial ischemic reperfusion (IR) injury in rats,"Zhang, Jing;Wang, Haiyan;Zheng, Qiangsun",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,2013,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,2013-01-01,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.060,2-s2.0-84878363219,Anti-inflammatory | Antioxidant | Aralia elata | Cardioprotective | Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury | Polysaccharide,"Based on the previous studies revealing antioxidant activities of a water-soluble polysaccharide (AEP-w1) from the root bark of Aralia elata, the present study was designed to determine if chronic administration of AEP-w1 could reduce ischemic reperfusion (IR) induced myocardial injury. Wistar rats were given three different doses of AEP-w1 (50, 100 and 200. mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 30 days, after which myocardial IR injury was induced by the occlusion of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 45. min followed by 60. min of reperfusion. Pretreatment with AEP-w1 not only enhanced the serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), but also decreased the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level in rats suffering IR injury. Consistent with this observation, AEP-w1 treatment also restored the myocardial antioxidant status evidenced by increased SOD, catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) and decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as compared to the IR model group. Furthermore, the elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, and decreased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in vehicle-treated IR rats was reversed by pretreatment with AEP-w1. In addition, AEP-w1 prevented myocardial cell from apoptosis in mice subjected to IR injury. These findings revealed that cardioprotective effect of AEP-w1 was achieved likely through improving endogenous antioxidants, regulating the inflammation response and suppressing myocardial cell apoptosis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Aim of the study: We investigated the cardioprotective effect of purified Salvia miltiorrhiza extract (SME) in an experimental model of acute myocardial infarction. Materials and methods: Following induction of acute myocardial infarction in rats by adminstration of isoproterenol, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters were monitored and recorded continuously, cardiac enzymes and parameters of oxidative stress were measured, and histopathological examination of heart tissue was performed. Experiments were performed in rats treated with SME or vehicle, as well as in those treated with Fufang Danshen Tablet (FDT) as a positive control which has previously been shown to prevent myocardial ischemia. Results: Isoproterenol-treated rats showed reductions in left ventricular systolic pressure as well as in maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, together with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. They also demonstrated ST-segment elevation, together with increases in serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde, as well as decreases in serum activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Oral administration of SME (29.76 or 59.52 mg/kg) blunted all of the hemodynamic and biochemical changes induced by isoproterenol, as did FDT (1210 mg/kg). The protective effect of SME on isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. Conclusions: Our results suggest that SME affords protection against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

But model checkers tend to support low-level modeling languages that require intricate models to represent even the simplest systems. Modeling complexity arises in part from the need to encode domain knowledge at relatively low levels of abstraction. In this paper, we demonstrate that formalized domain knowledge can be reused to raise the abstraction level of model and property specifications, and hence the effectiveness of model checking. We describe a novel method for domain-specific model checking called cascading verification that uses composite reasoning over high-level system specifications and formalized domain knowledge to synthesize both low-level system models and their behavioral properties for verification. In particular, model builders use a high-level domain-specific language (DSL) based on YAML to express system specifications that can be verified with probabilistic model checking. Domain knowledge is encoded in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and Prolog, which are used in combination to overcome their individual limitations. A compiler then synthesizes models and properties for verification by the probabilistic model checker PRISM. We illustrate cascading verification for the domain of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), for which we have constructed a prototype implementation. An evaluation of this prototype reveals nontrivial reductions in the size and complexity of input specifications compared to the artifacts synthesized for PRISM. Copyright 2013 ACM."

With regular health screening, disease detection and subsequent medical attention can proceed with far lesser chance of missing the critical period. The projection of health related issues from health screening has been studied by using statistical analysis methods. However, the results generally fail to alert the subjects regarding the potential risks involved due to lack of certainty. The potential health issues derived from statistical analysis of health screening data and medical general guidelines can only be presented to the subjects with probability and lack of supportive hard evidence. The efficacy of health screening consequently fails to be realized. In order to confront the dilemma, we have developed an Intelligent Health Projection System (IHPS) for providing an evidential health status projection and a more motivated health plan to the subjects. This study focuses on modelling Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and associated factors as an example. Other cases can be analogously implemented. The IHPS adaptively provides the projection of potential risk of getting T2DM by exploring the similarity between the subject's health screening data and previous T2DM patients' cases. The main building blocks, the cases that serve as a knowledge base for IHPS are modelled using ontology technology. As the main functionality of IHPS, the T2DM projection uses the traces left by previous T2DM patients and works on top of casebased reasoning mechanism. The proposed IHPS aims to promote better self-health management by enhancing a subject's comprehension on risks revealed in health screening result. The cases retrieved can not only being used for risk projection of a subject but also serving as evidences for physicians to provide more accurate and convincing health advice."

Based on the simulation of mixed traffic flow for multi-density conditions, the density-speed diagrams have been obtained consequently. According to the analysis, when the traffic density of the opposite lane is low, the opposite driving behavior of emergency vehicle can improve the average speed effectively. At the same time, if the cocurrent lane is in high-density traffic, the traffic in the opposite lane will be disturbed, but the vehicles in the cocurrent lane will not be affected. The paper has further discussed the influence of different emergency vehicle driving behaviors on traffic. The results reveal that as the traffic of the opposite lane is in a low-density range, if emergency vehicle operates overtaking behavior precisely, the greater the density of the cocurrent lane is, the more obviously the speed improve. Meanwhile large random fluctuation of overtaking times will occur. While the risky lane change behavior displays different traffic characteristics, that is when the same direction lane is in high density, the speed increases slightly and the lane change number is changed regularly."

It is based on modal aerosol dynamics modeling with log-normal assumption of particle distributions. The model has an Eulerian sub-model providing detailed spatial information within the computational domain and a computationally less expensive, but spatial-information-lacking, Lagrangian sub-model. Particle formation in a laboratory sampling system that includes a porous tube-type diluter and an aging chamber was modeled with CFD-TUTEAM. The simulation results imply that over 99% of new particles are formed in the aging chamber region because the nucleation rate remains at a high level in the aging chamber due to low dilution ratio and low nucleation exponents. The nucleation exponents for sulfuric acid in sulfuric-acid-water nucleation ranging from 0.25 to 1 appeared to fit best with measurement data, which are the same values as obtained from the slopes of the measured volatile nucleation mode number concentration vs. the measured raw exhaust sulfuric acid concentration. These nucleation exponents are very low compared to the nucleation exponents obtained from the classical nucleation theory of binary sulfuric-acid-water nucleation. The values of nucleation exponent lower than unity suggest that other compounds, such as hydrocarbons, might have a significant role in the nucleation process."

We numerically investigate the influences of the MTDCs and the driving injections, the mismatch robustness and detuning tolerance, the chaos pass filtering effects, and the multichannel communication performance. The numerical simulations demonstrate that stable ICS can be readily achieved in the present system as long as the driving injections are properly strong, and it is not restricted by the coupling delays, which is more advanced than that of MTDCSLs with self-feedback where the ICS is closely related to the relationship between the coupling delays and the feedback delays. Moreover, the ICS is robust to relatively large mismatch of the pumping current and device parameters and is robust to frequency detuning up to tens of gigahertz. When the external modulation technique is adopted, striking chaos pass filtering effects that are not limited by the relaxation oscillation frequency are observed in each coupling path, which enables us to transmit 2n messages over n coupling paths simultaneously.

We propose two algorithms to place a number of charging stations so that a robot is always capable of reaching one of the charging stations from any obstacle-free location in the workspace without aborting its task too early. We reduce the charging-station placement problem to a series of Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) problems and use the off-the-shelf SMT solver Z3 to implement our algorithm. The algorithm produces as output the locations of the charging stations in the workspace and the trajectories from any obstacle-free locations to one of the charging stations. Our experimental results show how our algorithm can efficiently find the locations of the charging stations and robot trajectories to reach the charging stations. We demonstrate through simulation how the generated trajectories can be effectively used by a robot to reach a charging stations autonomously without getting depleted with power."

Fractionated spacecraft, smart cities computing architectures, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters are all examples of extensible CPS wherein extensibility is implied by the dynamic aggregation of physical resources, affect of physical dynamics on availability of computing resources, and various multi-domain applications hosted on these systems. However, realization of extensible CPS requires resolving design-time and runtime challenges emanating from properties specific to these systems. In this paper, we first describe different properties of extensible CPS - dynamism, extensibility, remote deployment, security, heterogeneity and resilience. Then we identify different design-time challenges stemming from heterogeneity and resilience requirements. We particularly focus on software heterogeneity arising from availability of various communication middleware. We then present appropriate solutions in the context of a novel domain specific language and describe how this language and its features have evolved from our past work."

This paradigm is often referred to as edge computing. If edge resources are pooled together, they can be used as decentralized shared resources for IoT applications, providing increased capacity to scale up computations and minimize end-to-end latency. Managing applications on these edge resources is hard, however, due to their remote, distributed, and (possibly) dynamic nature, which necessitates autonomous management mechanisms that facilitate application deployment, failure avoidance, failure management, and incremental updates. To address these needs, we present CHARIOT, which is orchestration middleware capable of autonomously managing IoT systems consisting of edge resources and applications. CHARIOT implements a three-layer architecture. The topmost layer comprises a system description language, the middle layer comprises a persistent data storage layer and the corresponding schema to store system information, and the bottom layer comprises a management engine that uses information stored persistently to formulate constraints that encode system properties and requirements, thereby enabling the use of satisfiability modulo theory solvers to compute optimal system (re)configurations dynamically at runtime. This article describes the structure and functionality of CHARIOT and evaluates its efficacy as the basis for a smart parking system case study that uses sensors to manage parking spaces."

Chronic administration of quercetin prevent spatial learning and memory deficits provoked by chronic stress in rats,"Said Mohammadi, Hadis;Goudarzi, Iran;Lashkarbolouki, Taghi;Abrari, Kataneh;Elahdadi Salmani, Mahmoud",Behavioural Brain Research,2014,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Behavioural Brain Research,2014-08-15,10.1016/j.bbr.2014.05.015,2-s2.0-84901481027,Chronic stress | Oxidative stress | Quercetin | Rat | Spatial memory,"There are several reports that cognitive impairment is observed in stress related disorders and chronic stress impairs learning and memory. However, very few studies have looked into the possible ways of preventing this stress-induced deficit. This research study was conducted to evaluate the effects of quercetin, a natural flavonoid, with strong antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties, on chronic stress induced learning and memory deficits and oxidative stress in hippocampus. For chronic stress, rats were restrained daily for 6. h/day (from 9:00 to 15:00) for 21 days in well-ventilated plexiglass tubes without access to food and water. The animals were injected with quercetin or vehicle 60. min before restraint stress over a period of 21 days. Then, rats trained with six trials per day for 6 consecutive days in the water maze. On day 28, a probe test was done to measure memory retention. In addition, oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus were evaluated. Results of this study demonstrated that chronic stress exposure rats exhibited higher escape latency during training trials and reduced time spent in target quadrant, higher escape location latency and average proximity in probe trial test. Quercetin (50. mg/kg) treatment during restraint stress (21 days) markedly decreased escape latency and increased time spent in target quadrant during Morris water maze task. In comparison to vehicle treated group, chronic-stress group had significantly higher malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, significantly higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and significantly lower glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in the hippocampus. Quercetin treatment caused a significant decrease in the hippocampus MDA levels and improves SOD and GPx activities in stressed animals. Finally, quercetin significantly decreased plasma corticosterone levels in stressed animals. Based on results of this study, chronic stress has detrimental effects on learning and memory and quercetin treatment can prevent from oxidative stress and impairment of learning and memory induced by chronic stress. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."
Chronic non-invasive corticosterone administration abolishes the diurnal pattern of tph2 expression,"Donner, Nina C.;Montoya, Christian D.;Lukkes, Jodi L.;Lowry, Christopher A.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2012,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2012-05-01,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.08.008,2-s2.0-84858438899,5-HT | ACTH | Adrenocorticotropin | Anxiety | Corticosterone | Depression | Glucocorticoid | Glucose | HPA axis | Raphe | Serotonin | Stress | Tph2 | Tryptophan hydroxylase,"Both hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and serotonergic systems are commonly dysregulated in stress-related psychiatric disorders. We describe here a non-invasive rat model for hypercortisolism, as observed in major depression, and its effects on physiology, behavior, and the expression of tph2, the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2, the rate-limiting enzyme for brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) synthesis. We delivered corticosterone (40μg/ml, 100μg/ml or 400μg/ml) or vehicle to adrenal-intact adult, male rats via the drinking water for 3 weeks. On days 15, 16, 17 and 18, respectively, the rats' emotionality was assessed in the open-field (OF), social interaction (SI), elevated plus-maze (EPM), and forced swim tests (FST). On day 21, half of the rats in each group were killed 2. h into the dark phase of a 12/12. h reversed light/dark cycle; the other half were killed 2. h into the light phase. We then measured indices of HPA axis activity, plasma glucose and interleukin-6 (IL-6) availability, and neuronal tph2 expression at each time point. Chronic corticosterone intake was sufficient to cause increased anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in a dose-dependent manner. It also disrupted the diurnal pattern of plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), corticosterone, and glucose concentrations, caused adrenal atrophy, and prevented regular weight gain. No diurnal or treatment-dependent changes were found for plasma concentrations of IL-6. Remarkably, all doses of corticosterone treatment abolished the diurnal variation of tph2 mRNA expression in the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) by elevating the gene's expression during the animals' inactive (light) phase. Our data demonstrate that chronic elevation of corticosterone creates a vulnerability to a depression-like syndrome that is associated with increased tph2 expression, similar to that observed in depressed patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

In this paper, we address the problem of traffic reconstruction, visualization, and animation using mobile vehicle data (i.e. GPS traces). We first conduct city-scale traffic reconstruction using statistical learning on mobile vehicle data for traffic animation and visualization, and then dynamically complete missing data using metamodel-based simulation optimization in areas of insufficient data coverage. We evaluate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively, and demonstrate our results with 2D visualization of citywide traffic, as well as 2D and 3D animation of reconstructed traffic in virtual environments."

Additionally, we propose and implement an end-to-end quality of service framework for the Future Internet and extend the virtual path slice engine to support future Internet technologies such as OpenFlow. The proposed framework is evaluated in distinct multiple autonomous scenarios for a city with a population of 1 million inhabitants, emulating xDSL (Digital Subscriber Line), LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and Fibre networking scenarios. The obtained results confirm the suitability of the proposed architecture between multiple autonomous systems, considering both data and control traffic scalability, as well as resilience and failure recovery.

However, it is very challenging to develop large scale audio event recognition models. On the one hand, usually there are only ""weak"" labeled audio training data available, which only contains labels of audio events without temporal boundaries. On the other hand, the distribution of audio events is generally long-tailed, with only a few positive samples for large amounts of audio events. These two issues make it hard to learn discriminative acoustic features to recognize audio events especially for long-tailed events. In this paper, we propose a novel class-aware self-attention mechanism with attention factor sharing to generate discriminative clip-level features for audio event recognition. Since a target audio event only occurs in part of an entire audio clip and its corresponding temporal interval varies, the proposed class-aware self-attention approach learns to highlight relevant temporal intervals and to suppress irrelevant noises at the same time. In order to learn attention patterns effectively for those long-tailed events, we combine both the domain knowledge and data driven strategies to share attention factors in the proposed attention mechanism, which transfers the common knowledge learned from other similar events to the rare events. The proposed attention mechanism is a pluggable component and can be trained end-to-end in the overall AER model. We evaluate our model on a large-scale audio event corpus ""Audio Set"" with both short-term and long-term acoustic features. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which improves the overall audio event recognition performance with different acoustic features especially for events with low resources. Moreover, the experiments also show that our proposed model is able to learn new audio events with a few training examples effectively and efficiently without disturbing the previously learned audio events."

Methodical development of such applications can benefit from approaches based on domain-specific languages (DSLs). However, the evolution and customization of heterogeneous components introduces significant challenges to accommodating the syntax and semantics of a DSL in addition to the heterogeneous platforms on which they must run. In this paper, we address the challenge of implementing code generators for two such DSLs that are flexible (resilient to changes in generators or input formats), extensible (able to support multiple output targets and multiple input variants), and modular (generated code can be re-written). Our approach, Clearwater, leverages XML and XSLT standards: XML supports extensibility and mutability for in-progress specification formats, and XSLT provides flexibility and extensibility for multiple target languages. Modularity arises from using XML meta-tags in the code generator itself, which supports controlled addition, subtraction, or replacement to the generated code via XML-weaving. We discuss the use of our approach and show its advantages in two non-trivial code generators: the Infopipe Stub Generator (ISG) to support distributed flow applications, and the Automated Composable Code Translator to support automated distributed application deployment. As an example, the ISG accepts as input an XML description and generates output for C, C++, or Java using a number of communications platforms such as sockets and publish-subscribe.

To address these difficulties, we have proposed a model-driven strategy using actions for informative observation and have developed some core methods based on this strategy [1][2][3]. In this paper, we show how these core methods can be used for an actual task that involves handling an item of clothing. In addition to proposing a sequence for this task, basic functions for realizing the sequence are also described.

For the task to pick up a specific part of the clothes, it is indispensable to obtain the 3D position and posture of the part. In order to robustly obtain such information from 3D observed data of the clothes, we take a deformable-model- driven approach[4], that recognizes the clothes state by comparing the observed data with candidate shapes which are predicted in advance. To carry out this approach despite large shape variation of the clothes, we propose a two-staged method. First, small number of representative 3D shapes are calculated through physical simulations of hanging the clothes. Then, after observing clothes, each representative shape is deformed so as to fit the observed 3D data better. The consistency between the adjusted shapes and the observed data is checked to select the correct state. Experimental results using actual observations have shown the good prospect of the proposed method. © 2009 IEEE."

Domain specific simulation and engineering tools partly address the challenges of complex system behavior. Different component technologies, customer behavior and controls in the power networks are interacting in a highly dynamic manner. Results of isolated simulations may be not accurate enough on the system level. Free and open available tools like GridLAB-D, PSAT, OpenModelica and 4DIAC are well known and widely used because of their excellent domain specific expertise. With co-simulation approaches the individual strengths of each tool can be exploited to model and simulate the various aspects of complex smart grids. The achieved level of detail and realism potentially surpasses the results that the individual analyses would gain. This paper demonstrates a local smart charging control strategy implemented with the IEC 61499-based standard for distributed control systems. It is simulated with different electric vehicle driving patterns, modeled with the multi-agent environment GridLAB-D. Battery models are defined in OpenModelica and embedded as individual dynamic loads. The power system is simulated using PSAT.

The perception component helps users define a library of object and scene parts that the robot can later detect. The manipulation component lets users define actions for manipulating objects or scene parts through programming by demonstration. Finally, the high-level programming component provides a drag-and-drop interface with which users can program the logic and control flow to accomplish a task using their previously specified perception and manipulation capabilities.

Then, a complete system package is generated according to the quadruple model. Finally, all of the components are packaged and deployed to a cloud. CodingBlind is easy to use because it only takes printed forms and BPMNs as inputs. Self-defining data and business logic make the generated cloud services flexible. Moreover, the business logic is strictly controlled by the FSM, which provides natural isolation for cloud applications. Case studies and experiments are conducted to assess the proposed approach, and the results show that it is feasible, convenient, and flexible."

Therefore, it is desirable to establish a much better grounding for cognitive behaviors modeling. In the context of domain specific modeling, metamodeling from scratch for designing such a scripting language poses some limitations, among which is the issue of integrating various models that are represented by various customized languages with different syntax and semantics, together with a large expenditure of designing, implementing, and maintaining these languages and their supporting resources. Instead, UML profile-based metamodeling is adopted, as a lightweight extension to capture the cognitive domain specific concepts, relationships, and constraints. Moreover, a unifying framework is proposed to guide the cognitive domain specific profiles design. Upon this framework, the development process is shown through constructing an anti-submarine tactical profile in combat effectiveness simulation systems domain and the feasibility of the domain specific language is illustrated with an armed escort scenario."

Fast advancement of technology has recently generated increased interest for previously non-feasible approaches for providing feedback based on learning behavioral observations by exploiting different traces of learning processes stored in information systems. Such learner behavior data makes it possible to observe different aspects of learning processes in which feedback needs of learners (e.g. difficulties, engagement issues, inefficient learning processes, etc.) based on individual learning trajectories can be traced. By identifying problems earlier in a learning process it is possible to deliver individualized feedback helping learners to take control of their own learning, i.e. to become self-regulated learners, and teachers to understand individual feedback needs and/or adapt their teaching strategies. In this work we (i) propose cognitive computer-assisted feedback mechanisms using a combination of MDE based simulation augmented with automated feedback, and (ii) discuss perspectives for behavioral feedback, i.e. feedforward, that can be based on learning process analytics in the context of learning conceptual modeling. Aggregated results of our previous studies assessing the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive feedback method with respect to improved understanding on different dimensions of knowledge, as well as feasibility of behavioral feedforward automation based on learners behavior patterns, are presented. Despite our focus on conceptual modeling and specific diagrams, the principles of the approach presented in this work can be used to support educational feedback automation for a broader spectrum of diagram types beyond the scope of conceptual modeling."

Reading instruction was varied according to a 2 × 2 experimental design with factors 'drawing pictures of text content on paper' (yes, no) and 'mentally imagining text content while reading' (yes, no). The results indicate that drawing pictures, mediated through increased cognitive load, decreased text comprehension and, thus, learning (d = -0.37), whereas mental imagery, although decreasing cognitive load, increased comprehension only when students did not have to draw pictures simultaneously (d = 0.72). No evidence was found that the effects were moderated by domain-specific prior knowledge, verbal ability, or spatial ability. The results are in line with cognitive theories of multimedia learning, self-regulated learning, and mental imagery as well as conceptions of science learning that focus on promoting mental model construction by actively visualizing the content to be learned. Constructing mental images seems to reduce cognitive load and to increase comprehension and learning outcome when the mental visualization processes are not disturbed by externally drawing pictures on paper, whereas drawing pictures seems to increase cognitive load resulting in reduced comprehension and learning outcome. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The high complexity of today's network infrastructures and the demand for reliable and robust but inexpensive networks stimulated research on evolving networks to become more autonomous and therefore reducing the need for human intervention. The presented approach is based on integrating a Monitoring, Decision-Making, and Execution (MDE) cycle into the situation aware Network Element Cognitive Manager (NECM). Accepting that the end-to-end paradigm does not hold for all mechanisms, we enable the NECM to control in-network functionality. For the prototype the NECM is complemented by the Dynamic Protocol Composition Framework (DPCF) which allows to control and execute arbitrary protocol functionality in intermediate nodes. For the experiments we considered a wireless mesh backhaul network which is likely to suffer from packet loss depending on external conditions like weather, reflections on moving objects etc. We could show that packet loss or overload have been recognized and appropriate actions have been taken. The analysis of the experiments showed that the different phases of the M-D-E cyle differ in time consumption by several orders of magnitude which requires architectures for cognitive network management to be designed to align the different processes to achieve optimal results. © 2011 IIMC."

To enable these intelligence vehicles to acquire driving skills at a level comparable to that of human drivers, long short-term memory of previous self-driving processes is necessary, but is difficult to introduce into the above-mentioned frameworks. In this paper, we propose a model for self-driving cars called the cognitive map-based neural network (CMNN). Our framework consists of three parts: a convolutional neural network that can perceive the environment in the manner that the human visual cortex does, a cognitive map to describe the locations of objects in a complex traffic scene and the relationships among them, and a recurrent neural network to process long short-term memory from the cognitive map, which is updated in real time. The proposed model is built to simultaneously handle three tasks: i) detecting free space and lane boundaries, ii) estimating vehicle pose and obstacle distance, and iii) learning to plan and control based on the behaviors of a human driver. More significantly, our approach introduces external instructions during an end-to-end driving process. To test it, we created a large-scale road vehicle dataset (RVD) containing more than 50,000 labeled road images captured by three cameras. We implemented the proposed model on an embedded system."

Endemic in approaches to realize such intelligence in machines is catastrophic forgetting: sequential learning corrupts knowledge obtained earlier in the sequence, or tasks antagonistically compete for system resources. Methods for obviating catastrophic forgetting have sought to identify and preserve features of the system necessary to solve one problem when learning to solve another, or to enforce modularity such that minimally overlapping sub-functions contain task specific knowledge. While successful, both approaches scale poorly because they require larger architectures as the number of training instances grows, causing different parts of the system to specialize for separate subsets of the data. Here we present a method for addressing catastrophic forgetting called developmental compression. It exploits the mild impacts of developmental mutations to lessen adverse changes to previously-evolved capabilities and 'compresses' specialized neural networks into a generalized one. In the absence of domain knowledge, developmental compression produces systems that avoid overt specialization, alleviating the need to engineer a bespoke system for every task permutation and suggesting better scalability than existing approaches. We validate this method on a robot control problem and hope to extend this approach to other machine learning domains in the future."

It offers an open, platform-independent framework for designing distributed control systems, whereby the interface and behaviour of a component is described using a function block. On the other hand, in the robotics domain, the Robotic Technology Component specification proposes a framework that allows software components to be easily integrated in a robotic system. The focus of that specification is not so much on the definition of each component's internal behaviour, but rather on the management and interaction of those components. The combination of both these standards offers a comprehensive solution for designing robotic software components in a model-driven approach.

It specifies one or more service level objectives (SLO), to ensure that the QoS delivered has met customer expectations. However, It becomes hard to guarantee QoS levels and detect SLA violations. Therefore, we propose to use MDE (Model Driven Engineering) to express the SLA contract requirements. This latter, created with a specific modeling language (DSML), will be used harmonically with a Multi-agent systems (MASs) in order to monitor SLA violations in real-time. Indeed, MASs are suitable tools for self-detection of failures and self-monitoring of cloud operations and services, QoS negotiation and SLA management. They are designed to operate in a dynamically changing environment. Our main motivation is firstly to use MDE technology for the creation of the SLA contract and then to integrate MASs in order to control the quality of service contract and guarantee transparency and symmetry with respect to the SLA contract between prospective signatories."

High-performance can be provided by COTS Multi-Core System on Chips (MPSoC), however, as cores in these systems share the memory bandwidth they are susceptible to interference from each other, which is a problem for timing predictability. We achieve predictability on multi-cores by employing the predictable execution model (PREM), which splits execution into a sequence of memory and compute phases, and schedules these such that only a single core is executing a memory phase at a time. We present a toolchain consisting of a compiler and an Integer Linear Programming scheduling model. Our compiler uses loop analysis and tiling to transform application code into PREM compliant binaries. Furthermore, we solve the problem of scheduling execution on multiple cores while preventing interference of memory phases.

It notably allows freeing Cloud administrators of the burden of manually managing varying-demand services, while still enforcing Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). All Cloud artifacts, regardless of the layer carrying them, share many common characteristics. Thus, it should be possible to specify, (re)configure and monitor any XaaS (Anything-as-a-Service) layer in an homogeneous way. To this end, the CoMe4ACloud approach proposes a generic model-based architecture for autonomic management of Cloud systems. We derive a generic unique Autonomic Manager (AM) capable of managing any Cloud service, regardless of the layer. This AM is based on a constraint solver which aims at finding the optimal configuration for the modeled XaaS, i.e. the best balance between costs and revenues while meeting the constraints established by the SLA. We evaluate our approach in two different ways. Firstly, we analyze qualitatively the impact of the AM behavior on the system configuration when a given series of events occurs. We show that the AM takes decisions in less than 10 s for several hundred nodes simulating virtual/physical machines. Secondly, we demonstrate the feasibility of the integration with real Cloud systems, such as Openstack, while still remaining generic. Finally, we discuss our approach according to the current state-of-the-art."

However, studies in specific clinical settings have revealed diverse barriers to their effective use. In this paper, we address the following question: are there barriers prevalent across distinct workflows in clinical settings to using patient-generated data? We conducted a twopart investigation: a literature reviewof studies identifying such barriers; and interviews with clinical specialists across multiple roles, including emergency care, cardiology, mental health, and general practice. We identify common barriers in a six-stage workflow model of aligning patient and clinician objectives, judging data quality, evaluating data utility, rearranging data into a clinical format, interpreting data, and deciding on a plan or action. This workflow establishes common ground for HCI practitioners and researchers to explore solutions to improving the use of patient-generated data in clinical practices."

For the modeling of the inverter, a concentrated and equivalent method is used to process synthetically the CM interference source and the stray capacitance. For the parameter extraction in the power line model, a computation method that combines analytical method and finite element method is used. The modeling of the motor is based on measured date of the impedance and vector fitting technique. It is shown that the parasitic currents and interference voltage in the system can be simulated in the different parts of the prediction model in the conducted frequency range (150 kHz-30 MHz). Experiments have successfully confirmed that the approach is effective."

However, high level interaction will require semantic understanding of the environment. In this paper, we advocate that co-existence of assistive robots and humans can be leveraged to enhance the semantic understanding of the shared environment, and improve situation awareness. We propose a probabilistic framework that combines human activity sensor data generated by smart wearables with low level localisation data generated by robots. Based on this low level information and leveraging colocation events between a user and a robot, it can reason about semantic information and track humans and robots across different rooms. The proposed system relies on two-way sharing of information between the robot and the user. In the first phase, user activities indicative of room utility are inferred from consumer wearable devices and shared with the robot, enabling it to gradually build a semantic map of the environment. This will enable natural language interaction and high-level tasks for both assistive and co-working robots. In a second phase, via colocation events, the robot is able to share semantic information with the user, by labelling raw user data with semantic information about room type. Over time, the labelled data is used for training an Hidden Markov Model for room-level localisation, effectively making the user independent from the robot."

This study shows how the processes for developing new technologies are driven by a strong sense of idealism, with little or no commercial motivation. Thus, this represents a kind of community development and sharing with a number of unique characteristics. While the community is central to participants' endeavours of developing their systems, the participants are not representative of the typical member. On the contrary, they are examples of a minority that put in significant efforts of contributing to the larger group. What we argue is unique about the case we have presented is that the technology development starts out from a few number of highly motivated individuals that through limited collaboration with others builds technologies that get extensive proliferation and use within the community."

Taking inspiration from peripersonal space representations in humans, we present a framework on a humanoid robot that dynamically maintains such a protective safety zone, composed of the following main components: (i) a human 2D keypoints estimation pipeline employing a deep learning based algorithm, extended here into 3D using disparity; (ii) a distributed peripersonal space representation around the robots body parts; (iii) a reaching controller that incorporates all obstacles entering the robots safety zone on the fly into the task. Pilot experiments demonstrate that an effective safety margin between the robots and the humans body parts is kept. The proposed solution is flexible and versatile since the safety zone around individual robot and human body parts can be selectively modulated - -here we demonstrate stronger avoidance of the human head compared to rest of the body.

However, snice our emotion changes frequently in our daily lives, trying to collect the ground truth of such volatile emotions leads a storm of ESMs which could be burden to the users. In order to find better ESM methods, we propose and compare 3 ESMs, namely Randomized ESM that executes in randomly timings, Trigger ESM that executes when the user's behavior changes, and Unlocking ESM that sets up ESM on the unlocking screen. We constructed various emotional estimation models with four types of time granularity (1 day, 1/3 day, 3 hours, 1 hour) in four weeks experience with eight persons. As for the response rate, Unlocking ESM was the highest. In addition, it was clear that Unlocking ESM had the highest estimation accuracy in most cases."

It also increases the need for cross-domain functionality, such as centralized energy management or the orchestration of mechanical braking and electric energy recuperation during deceleration. This leads to new challenges with respect to architecture development as interconnections between features are introduced that are not yet fully understood. The vehicle's system architecture evolves from towards a distributed multi-functional control system. Component oriented, model based approaches with multiple viewpoints have already proven being suitable in other domains to manage the dependencies between functionality by decomposing a system into a network of functional entities encapsulated in components. In this paper, we present a domain-specific component model to describe functional interdependencies as well as non-functional requirements needed to enable safe integration of software components in a centralized automotive ICT architecture. The model enables the composition of high-level functions and the definition of compatibility constraints. The approach is then applied to unveil feature interaction in a component architecture. This forms the foundation of a sound development and integration process for heavily interconnected functions. It also enables on-line product validation mechanisms to ensure functional integrity and safety as well as meeting of deployment constraints and timing requirements."

But, basically, robotics arm applications need to get information, through sensors, from the variant and unknown environment; this is available to controllers which also have information about the robot's state (position, velocity, acceleration, torque, etcetera) and taking into account a reference, they generate the next state for the robot. Therefore, every robotic platform should require a set of sensors to take information from the environment, controllers and robots (with the low level controller). In order to cope with devices, which part of them exhibit vendor-dependent characteristics, a standard interface is proposed to allow the designers to abstract the vendor specific drivers' knowledge and to guide them in this work. This paper also explores the advantages of model-based techniques to design robotic-arm applications. In particular the Unified Modelling Language has been used for modelling the functionality in the robotic's manipulator applications, from where components of the OROCOS (Open RObot COntrol Software) are automatically generated. The proposition, characterized by its openness, productivity, portability and interoperability, is based on the construction of a complex robotic manipulator platform that integrates a Stäubli industrial robot and a MEKA anthropomorphic robotic arm. Both can be used, in an easy way, in advanced experiments as it is shown in the results. © 2013 IEEE."

A key challenge related to composition of such multi-organizational business processes and workflows is posed by the security and access control policies of the underlying organizational domains. In this paper, we propose a framework for verifying secure composability of distributed workflows in an autonomous multi-domain environment. The objective of workflow composability verification is to ensure that all the users or processes executing the designated workflow tasks conform to the time-dependent security policy specifications of all collaborating domains. A key aspect of such verification is to determine the time-dependent schedulability of distributed workflows, assumed to be invoked on a recurrent basis. We use a two-step approach for verifying secure workflow composability. In the first step, a distributed workflow is decomposed into domain-specific projected workflows and is verified for conformance with the respective domain's security and access control policy. In the second step, the cross-domain dependencies amongst the workflow tasks performed by different collaborating domains are verified."

Instead, it is composed of multiple independent interacting components that together ensure the desired system-level specification. One can scale systematic testing to large, industrial-scale implementations by decomposing the system-level testing problem into a collection of simpler component-level testing problems. This paper proposes techniques for compositional programming and testing of distributed systems with two central contributions: (1) We propose a module system based on the theory of compositional trace refinement for dynamic systems consisting of asynchronously-communicating state machines, where state machines can be dynamically created, and communication topology of the existing state machines can change at runtime; (2) We present ModP, a programming system that implements our module system to enable compositional reasoning (assume-guarantee) of distributed systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by building two practical fault-tolerant distributed systems, a transaction-commit service and a replicated hash-table. ModP helps implement these systems modularly and validate them via compositional testing. We empirically demonstrate that the abstraction-based compositional reasoning approach helps amplify the coverage during testing and scale it to real-world distributed systems. The distributed services built using ModP achieve performance comparable to open-source equivalents."

Then the average time taken on straight roads and fork roads is simulated. By adding together, an adjacent matrix regarding time could be obtained. Then this figure out the shortest driving time and path between any two positions.

Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants (e.g., other vehicles and traffic control devices), and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on three autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95% of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors (e.g., traffic behaviors) that lead to unrealistic environment behavior."

The ability to model a set of possible design alternatives-and to analyze and simulate the execution of the representative model-helps derive the correct set of QoS parameters needed to satisfy DRE system requirements. QoS adaptation is accomplished via rules that specify how to modify application or middleware behavior in response to changes in resource availability. This chapter presents a model-driven approach for generating QoS adaptation rules in DRE systems. This approach creates high-level graphical models representing QoS adaptation policies. The models are constructed using a domain-specific modeling language-the adaptive quality modeling language (AQML)-which assists in separating common concerns of a DRE system via different modeling views.

Most deformable models work by performing some kind of edge detection; complementary region growing methods have not often been used. As a result, deformable models that track regions rather than edges have yet to be developed to a great extent. Active region models are a relatively new type of deformable model driven by a region energy that is a function of the statistical characteristics of an image. This paper describes the use of constrained active region models for frame-rate tracking in color video images on widely available computer hardware. Two of the many color representations now in use are reviewed for this purpose: the intensity-based RGB space and the more intuitive HSV space. Normalized RGB, which is essentially a measure of hue and saturation, emerges as the preferred representation because it is invariant to illumination changes and can be obtained from many frame-grabbers via a simple fast software transformation. Three types of motion are examined for constraining deformable models: rigid models can only translate and rotate to fit image features; conformal models can also change size; affine models exhibit two kinds of shearing in addition to the other components. Two methods are described for producing affine motion, given the desired unconstrained motion calculated by searching for local energy minima lying perpendicular to the model boundary. An existing method, based on iterative gradient descent, computes translating, rotating, scaling, and shearing forces which can be combined to produce affine and other types of motion. A faster, more accurate method uses least-squares minimization to approximate the desired motion; with this method it is also possible to derive specific equations for rigid and conformal motion and to correct for the aperture problem associated with the perpendicular search method. The advantages of the new least-squares method are illustrated by using it to drive an active region model via an affine transformation which tracks the movements of a robot arm at frame rate in color video images. © 1998 Academic Press."

In this paper, software distribution challenges for such systems are discussed and solutions are presented for instruction precise modeling, affinity constrained distribution, and reducing task response times achieved by advanced software parallelization. Therefore, existing partitioning and mapping algorithms are advanced to consider affinity constraints, software component tags and communication costs. Our experiments along a remote controlled model car show that using our new advanced results instead of sequential implementations or software distributions provided by the operating system on a distributed heterogeneous system significantly improves its responsiveness in order to potentially reduce energy consumption and replaces error prone manual constraint considerations for mixed-critical applications."

The last few years were marked by the development of a large number of in-vehicle intelligent systems that use driving behavior models to assist the driver ubiquitously. However, an important aspect to enhance driving experience is to make the provided assistance as close as possible to the behavior of the car owner, hence a need of personal models of drivers learned from their observed behavior.

This paper proposes the least square support vector machine ((LSSVM) with time-delayed features (TDF) of sEMG for the continuous wrist palmar flexion-extension angle estimation. The performance of proposed method is verified via an experimental platform for sEMG and angle data records. The feasibility of introducing a time delay value into two machine learning models namely, LSSVM, back propagation neural network (BP), for sEMG-angle estimation is proved. The average correlation coefficients and the average root mean square error (RMSE) of LSSVM with TDF are 9.36±2.5 degree and 0.96±0.02 respectively. This paper obtains three conclusions: 1.The estimation performance of LLSVM and BP neural network have been much improved after a proper single time delay is introduced into the models; 2. An empirical calculation of the optimal time delay value can be obtained in which the optimal time delay is linear with the size of window N; 3.The LLSVM with TDF exhibits the best estimation performance in continuous wrist angle prediction from the sEMG features."

The Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) is a control methodology designed to solve the stabilization problem of underactuated systems. In this paper, we present an application of this control methodology to a self-balancing robot, by using an extension of the IDA-PBC method, which includes actuator dynamics.

However, most of these mechanisms are tailored to specific applications and can hardly be generalized into broadly applicable software design and development processes. This article discusses a reference control design process, from goal identification to the verification and validation of the controlled system.

Both kinematic and dynamic modelling of these robots is difficult due to sliding and rolling inherent in general curvilinear motion. In order to improve motion and pose estimation, this paper proposes a kinematic and dynamic model for skid-steered mobile robots. A PID controller, tuned using Genetic Algorithm, based on the dynamic model is then proposed for accurate control of the skid-steered robot. .e dynamic model developed enables motion planning for general planar motion. The coefficient of rolling resistance, the coefficient of friction, and the shear deformation modulus, all of which have terrain-dependent values are accommodated in this model. Surveillance bots are of great importance in protecting and saving human life. In this context, mobile and multi-functional robots which map their surroundings are adopted as a means to reduce environmental restructuring and the number of devices used to cover a given area. Skid-steered robots are robust and, therefore, are ideal for surveillance applications."

The controller design considers a variable position for the point of interest and takes into account also the robot constrained inputs. The obtained inverse kinematics controller is differentiable, time invariant and naturally incorporates the sideway slipping which is considered measurable. Moreover, the proposed controller can be used for both: trajectory tracking and path following by setting appropriate desired values at the planning stage. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the control system. Simulator includes a robot dynamics module that supports physics engines.

In order to ease engineering and to cope with changing environmental or system properties, these subsystems need to be self-adapting. But for this to be feasible, they cannot observe the theoretically required state space of the whole system. Instead, they need to work with a reduced set of input variables. This leads to a lack of information which may induce unintended, dynamic interactions between the self-adaptation processes. Within this paper, a method is proposed in order to control the self-adaptation processes and to fight these interactions in a goal directed way.

Extending their operational range is key and can be achieved by means of design procedures based on high-fidelity models capturing the dynamical behavior of the electric drivetrain. This paper proposes a dedicated power split embodying a dual electric drive and a model-based strategy to design the drivetrain. Advancements are required in model-based design that can cope with the complexity of the computationally expensive and high-dimensional parametric design problems. We propose a nested optimization approach wherein parameter exploration is attained using an evolutionary algorithm and the optimal power flows are determined by abstracting the high-fidelity behavioral models into appropriate convex loss mappings. This allows for an accelerated design procedure based on convex optimization without compromising accuracy. We size an electric drivetrain for maximal range extension, consisting of a battery stack, buck-boost converter, inverter and mechanically coupled induction motors subjected to variable load conditions. A tractable convex formulation is obtained and optimization time is reduced by 99.3% compared to the traditional approach without convexification. Optimal control of the incorporated power split increases the operational range by 0.7% compared to the isolated operation of a single motor. The proposed methodology thus paves the way for extensive designs of drivetrains and complex mechatronic systems in a general context."

However, securely admitting a new vehicle into a platoon is an extremely important yet difficult task. There is no adequate method today for verifying physical arrangements of vehicles within a platoon formation. Specifically, we address the problem of a platoon ghost attack wherein an attacker spoofs presence within a platoon to gain admission and subsequently execute malicious attacks. To address such concerns, we present Convoy, a novel autonomous platoon admission scheme which binds the vehicles' digital certificates to their physical context (i.e., locality). Convoy exploits the findings that vehicles traveling together experience similar context to prove to each other over time that they are co-present. Specifically, they experience similar road (e.g., bumps and cracks) and traffic (e.g., acceleration and steering) conditions. Our approach is based on the ability for vehicles to capture this context, generate fingerprints to establish shared keys, and later bind these symmetric keys to their public keys. We design and implement the Convoy protocol and evaluate it with real-world driving data. Our implementation demonstrates that vehicles traveling in adjacent lanes can be sufficiently distinguished by their context and this can be utilized to thwart platoon ghost attacks and similar misbehavior."

We presented our solution in the form of a coordination mechanism, which includes a labor-market model, a recruiting protocol, and a policy-driven decision architecture. Peers make their service providing decisions based on their local policies, which can be added, removed, or modified by users.

All rights reserved.Motivated by the high electric vehicle (EV) penetration percentages foreseen for the near future, we study the integration of large fleets of electric vehicles into the existing electricity market structure, with special emphasis on day-ahead markets. Specifically, the large energy requirements characteristic of the widespread use of EVs require careful managing in order to limit environmental and infrastructural impacts. A key characteristic of EVs is their intrinsic flexibility, given that most vehicles are idle most of the day. This translates into coordination opportunities which allow for the temporal spreading of the energy consumption of an EV fleet, avoiding unnecessary demand peaks which translate into increased electricity prices and stress in the grid. Given the self-interested nature of market participants, this coordination is challenging and needs to be carefully addressed."

Specifically, we study a scen ario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators (e.g. car parks or electricity suppliers) who compete in the day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients' requirements. In order to reduce electricity Costs and lower the impact on electricity markets, we study the possibility of inter-aggregator cooperation. Specifically, we model the system as a coalitional game and prove that the resulting game is superadditive and balanced, hence having a non-empty core. However, due to the game not being convex, the Shapley value is not guaranteed to lie in the core. As an alternative, we propose emp loying the payment mechanism provided by the least-core, which we show to be in the core in our setting. Furthermore, a realistic empirical evaluation is presented, using real market and driver data from the Iberian Peninsula. The simulations show that large payment reductions can be achieved when using the coordination mechanism. Moreover, we show that the individual payments of the least-core are very close to the Shapley value, suggesting that the payment mechanism is both fair and stable."

The regression models of the recursive least squares (RLS) with forgetting factors and constraints are constructed based on simplified lateral dynamic models for estimating tire cornering stiffness. In addition, a nonlinear observer of sideslip angle is designed for four-in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles (FIWMD-EVs) with the estimated information on tire cornering stiffness. Sideslip angle can be estimated through a first-order Stirling’s interpolation filter (DD1-filter) and a firstorder low-pass filter. The reliability, feasibility, effectiveness, and practicality of simplified lateral dynamic models are verified by contrast simulation experiments. The simplified lateral dynamic models of front and rear tires are not influenced on the change of sideslip angle, nor influenced by each other. Moreover, it can result in improving computation speed that computational burden is reduced after simplifying lateral dynamic models. With the estimated information above mentioned, sideslip angle is also estimated well. The estimated information on tire cornering stiffness and sideslip angle is benefit to the design of lateral stability control system, which can make vehicle adapt to different road conditions and control the steering motion attitude of vehicle in future works."

The goals of the project were to develop and implement a web-enhanced interactive learning experience in a preclinical restorative technique course and shift preclinical education from a teacher-centered experience to a student-driven experience. The project was evaluated using an anonymous post-course survey (95 percent response rate) of 123 freshman students that assessed enabling (technical support and access to the technology), process (the actual experience and usability), and outcome criteria (acquisition and successful use of the knowledge gained and skills learned) of the online manual. Students responded favorably to sections called ""slide galleries"" where ideal and non-ideal examples of projects could be viewed. Causes, solutions, and preventive measures were provided for the errors shown. Sections called ""slide series"" provided cookbook directions allowing for self-paced and student-directed learning. Virtually all of the students, 99 percent, found the quality of the streaming videos adequate to excellent. Regarding Internet connections and video viewing, 65 percent of students successfully viewed the videos from a remote site; cable connections were the most reliable, dial-up connections were inadequate, and DSL connections were variable. Seventy-three percent of the students felt the videos were an effective substitute for in-class demonstrations.

Six surfactants and four oils were screened with various combinations for maximal water incorporation and PAC solubility. Microemulsion regions were subsequently determined in ternary phase diagrams. Cytotoxicity in an MDA-M231 human breast cancer cell line and hemolytic potential were assessed in these systems compared to Taxol® (cremophor EL:ethanol, 1:1, 6 mg PAC/ml). The maximal water incorporation into the lecithin:butanol surfactant blend was greater than that incorporated into capmul when combined with the oils screened. PAC solubility in myvacet oil was increased 1389-fold over its aqueous solubility. LBMW had a larger microemulsion region (46.5% of total ternary phase diagram) than that seen with CMW (18.6%). The droplet size of the dispersed phase was 111.5 (4.18) nm for LBMW and 110.3 (8.09) nm for CMW. Cytotoxicity of PAC was in decreasing order of: Taxol® > LBMW > CMW. The IC50 values for LBMW and CMW ranged from 4.5 to 5.7 and >10 μM, respectively, as compared to that of Taxol® (1.3 to 1.8 μM). Eighty-three percent, 68%, and 63% of red blood cells remain unlysed at a formulation volume to blood ratio of 0.035 in LBMW, CMW and Taxol®. Promising microemulsions, LBMW and CMW were developed that can incorporate approximately 12 mg/g of PAC, substantially higher than its aqueous solubility (10.8 μg/ml) and that in the Taxol® vehicle (6 mg/ml). PAC retained its cytotoxicity in the LBMW and CMW and was less likely to cause hemolysis compared to Taxol®. This higher drug loading results in a smaller vehicle volume in required doses of these formulations and potentially less vehicle-related side effects are anticipated. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Such active WSN applications are more autonomous, but are significantly more complex to implement. Event-based middleware lends itself to implementing these applications. It offers developers fine-grained control over how an individual node interacts with the other nodes of the network. However, this control comes at the cost of event handlers which lack composability and violate software engineering principles such as separation of concerns. In this paper, we present CrimeSPOT as a domain-specific language for programming WSN applications on top of event-driven middleware. Its node-centric features enable programming a node's interactions through declarative rules rather than event handlers. Its network-centric features support reusing code within and among WSN applications. Unique to CrimeSPOT is its support for associating application-specific semantics with events that carry sensor readings. These preclude transposing existing approaches that address the shortcomings of event-based middleware to the domain of wireless sensor networks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the language and the implementation of its accompanying runtime. The latter comprises several extensions to the Rete forward chaining algorithm. We evaluate the expressiveness of the language and the overhead of its runtime using small, but representative active WSN applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

All right reserved.Recent advances in 3D capturing devices and 3D modeling software have led to extensive and diverse 3D datasets, which usually have different distributions. Cross-domain 3D model retrieval is becoming an important but challenging task. However, existing works mainly focus on 3D model retrieval in a closed dataset, which seriously constrain their implementation for real applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel cross-domain 3D model retrieval method by visual domain adaptation. This method can inherit the advantage of deep learning to learn multi-view visual features in the data-driven manner for 3D model representation. Moreover, it can reduce the domain divergence by exploiting both domain-shared and domain-specific features of different domains. Consequently, it can augment the discrimination of visual descriptors for cross-domain similarity measure. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets, under three designed cross-domain scenarios, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing against the state-of-the-art methods. Especially, the proposed method can significantly outperform the most recent method for cross-domain 3D model retrieval and the champion of Shrec'16 Large-Scale 3D Shape Retrieval from ShapeNet Core55."

However, research on player profiling focuses on generalized personality traits, not specific aspects of motivation. This study examines how player behaviour indicates constructs of curiosity-related motivation. It contributes a more discriminating operationalization of game-related curiosity. We derive a curiosity measure from established self-report survey methodologies relating to social capital, behavioural activation, obsessive/harmonious passion, and BrainHex player types. We present the results of a cross-sectional study with data from 1,745 players of Destiny - A popular shared-world first-person shooter (FPS) game. Behaviour metrics were paired with four curiosity factors: 'social' curiosity, 'sensory/cognitive' curiosity, 'novelty-seeking' curiosity, and 'explorative' curiosity. Our findings provide key insights into the relationships between players curiosity and their in-game behaviour. We infer curiosity-related motivational profiles from behaviour metrics, and discuss how this may impact game design and player-computer interaction."

Our current research informed us that the phenomenon of synergy has not been understood sufficiently yet, and that there are many, even competing, views on how to interpret and operationalize it in CPSs. We can talk about synergy when the functionally and geographically distributed dissimilar system components work in concert together and create a system behavior/performance that is of higher value than the total of the individual components is. Towards synergy, unification and interoperation principles need to be considered both in design and in implementation of CPSs. In this paper, we elaborate on the various aspects of synergy, and critically analyze its drivers and obstacles. Our analysis extended to ontological, epistemological, methodological, manifestation and operational aspects of synergy. It has been found that emergence of truly synergic technologies, proliferation of sophisticated abstraction models, model-driven system specification, and platform-based function realization are the most important drivers of synergy. On the other hand, the different mental models and vocabularies, the lack of multi-level informatics, the limitations in handling non-hierarchical complexities, managing emergent intelligence and autonomous operation, and the premature state of informing science have been identified as the major obstacles. The paper makes a proposal for enhanced synergy by taking the advantage of the affordances and reducing the effects of the obstacles. The results of the critical analysis are design principles that can be used to increase the level of synergy of CPSs. Copyright © 2012 by ASME."

Most of the models for generating non-verbal behavior are rule-based and hence can produce a limited set of motions and are tuned to a particular scenario. In contrast, data-driven systems are flexible and easily adjustable. Hence we aim to learn a data-driven model for generating non-verbal behavior (in a form of a 3D motion sequence) for humanoid robots. Our approach is based on a popular and powerful deep generative model: Variation Autoencoder (VAE). Input for our model will be multi-modal and we will iteratively increase its complexity: first, it will only use the speech signal, then also the text transcription and finally - the non-verbal behavior of the conversation partner. We will evaluate our system on the virtual avatars as well as on two humanoid robots with different embodiments: NAO and Furhat. Our model will be easily adapted to a novel domain: this can be done by providing application specific training data."

In this study, a condition monitoring index of bearings is developed based on self-organizing map (SOM) in order to detect incipient bearing faults quickly. It requires low computation cost and is robust to the change of load level and motor speed, hence is quite suitable for online condition monitoring of bearings. Furthermore, a novel hybrid algorithm combining diversified gradient descent (DGD) method and Bayesian model selection (BMS) called DGD-BMS for the optimization of discrete hidden Markov model (DHMM) parameters is formulated under a general Bayesian framework. The flexibility of the DGD-BMS consists in that the algorithm can increase the diversity of the searching paths generated for DHMM parameters so that the true underlying parameters are more likely to be found out. Thus it provides an effective way to avoid trapping in one local maximum. Both simulation and industrial case study are presented to validate the proposed approach. Results show that the monitoring index can detect incipient bearing faults efficiently with 100% accuracy even under varying load levels, and the DGD-BMS method achieves on average the classification rate of 99.58%. The proposed method exhibits excellent performance compared to the conventional gradient descent (GD) and Baum-Welch (BW) methods."

In dynamic modeling, fluid forces exerted on the robotic fish are analyzed by the Morrison equation and the strip method. A dynamic model with an explicit formulation is derived, in which all terms involved in the dynamic analysis are converted to the coordinate system attached to the head. Further, the parameter identification technique is integrated into dynamic modeling, which reshapes it with data-driven feature and thereby makes it be competent to model swimming robots with complex geometric profiles and numerous heterogeneous hydrodynamic parameters. Experimental data of the swimming robotic fish are collected to identify the parameters directly. The obtained dynamic model is validated by data captured under extensive motion modes like forward swimming, varying velocity, and turning. Comparisons of simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method."

Focusing on this problem, a data-driven dynamic modeling method is proposed using improved extreme learning machine (ELM) with the help of principle component analysis (PCA). First, data-driven PCA is introduced to pick out the most pivotal variables from multitudinous factors to serve as the secondary variables of modeling. Second, a novel data-driven ELM modeling technology with good generalization performance and nonlinear mapping capability is presented by applying a self-feedback structure on traditional ELM. The feedback outputs at previous time together with input variables at different time constitute a dynamic ELM structure which has a storage ability to tackle data in different time and overcomes the limitation of static modeling of traditional ELM. At last, industrial experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has a better modeling and estimating accuracy as well as a faster learning speed when compared with different modeling methods with different model structures."

The predictability in both systems is analyzed by means of a decision variable sensitive to event clustering, and the quality of the predictions is evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. In the case of the SOC sandpile model, the scaling of quiet-time distributions with increasing threshold leads to increased predictability of extreme events. A scaling theory allows us to understand all the details of the prediction procedure and to extrapolate the shape of the ROC curves for the most extreme events. For rainfall data, the quiet-time distributions do not scale for high thresholds, which means that the corresponding ROC curves cannot be straightforwardly related to those for lower thresholds. In this way, ROC curves are useful for highlighting differences in predictability of extreme events between toy models and real-world phenomena."

While merchants can observe markets at any point in time and automatically reprice their products, they also have to compete simultaneously with dozens of competitors. Currently, retailers lack the possibility to test, develop, and evaluate their algorithms appropriately before releasing them into the real world. At the same time, it is challenging for researchers to investigate how pricing strategies interact with each other under heavy competition. To study dynamic pricing competition on online marketplaces, we built an open simulation platform. To be both flexible and scalable, the platform has a micro-service-based architecture and handles large numbers of competing merchants and arriving consumers. It allows merchants to deploy the full width of pricing strategies, from simple rule-based strategies to more sophisticated data-driven strategies using machine learning. Our platform enables analyses of how a strategy's performance is affected by customer behavior, price adjustment frequencies, the competitors' strategies, and the exit/entry of competitors. Moreover, our platform allows to study the long-term behavior of self-adapting strategies."

Moreover, there is a need for frameworks which address both, the modeling process and the implementation task and allow a model-driven, semi-automatic engineering process using CASE tools. This paper outlines the DaVinci Web Engineering Framework which supports the modeling as well as the semi-automated implementation of Web applications. The DaVinci Architectural Layer specifies a persistent, hierarchical GUI model and a generic interaction scheme. This allows the elimination of the hypermedia paradigm, which turned out to be rather practical when building Web applications. © TROUBADOR PUBLISHING LTD."

This article draws attention to the issue, illustrating the difficulties it can cause for road vehicle aerodynamics simulations. Firstly a benchmark problem is used to assess a range of turbulence models and grid types. Large noise amplitudes up to 22% are evident for solutions computed on unstructured tetrahedral grids whereas computations on hexahedral and polyhedral grid structures exhibit substantially less noise. The Spalart Allmaras turbulence model is shown to be far less susceptible to noise levels than two other commonly-used models for this application. Secondly, multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimization is applied to a fairing for a practical road vehicle which is parameterised in terms of three design variables. Moving Least Squares (MLS) metamodels are constructed from 50 high-fidelity CFD solutions for two objective functions. Subsequent optimization is successful for the first objective, however numerical noise levels in excess of 7% give rise to difficulties for the second one. A revision to the problem leads to success and the construction of a small Pareto front. Further analysis underlines the inherent capability of MLS metamodels in dealing with noisy CFD responses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."
Debugging applications created by a Domain Specific Language: The \IPAC\ case,"Kolomvatsos, Kostas;Valkanas, George;Hadjiefthymiades, Stathes",Journal of Systems and Software,2012,ScienceDirect,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Journal of Systems and Software,2012-04-01,10.1016/j.jss.2011.11.1009,2-s2.0-84857359534,Debugger | Domain Specific Language | Software testing,"Nowadays, software developers have created a large number of applications in various research domains of Computer Science. However, not all of them are familiar with the majority of the research domains. Hence, Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) can provide an abstract, concrete description of a domain in terms that can easily be managed by developers. The most important in such cases is the provision of a debugger for debugging the generated software based on a specific DSL. In this paper, we propose and present a simple but efficient debugger created for the needs of the IPAC system. The debugger is able to provide debugging facilities to developers that define applications for autonomous mobile nodes. The debugger can map code lines between the initial application workflow and the final code defined in a known programming language. Finally, we propose a logging server responsible to provide debugging facilities for the IPAC framework. The IPAC system is consisted of a number of middleware services for mobile nodes acting in a network. In this system a number of mobile nodes exchanged messages that are visualized for more efficient manipulation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we propose a control design approach for FPGA-based reconfigurable systems aiming at increasing design productivity. This approach is based on a semi-distributed control model that splits different control concerns (monitoring, decision-making and reconfiguration) between autonomous modular controllers and makes use of formalism-oriented design, to decrease the control design complexity and facilitate design verification, reuse and scalability. This model is composed of distributed controllers handling the self-adaptivity of the system reconfigurable regions and a coordinator to respect the system global constraints. To enhance design productivity, the proposed control model is generated automatically using a high-level modeling approach. This approach is based on MDE (Model-Driven Engineering) and the MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems) standard, allowing to make low-level technical details transparent to designers and to automate code generation from high-level models. Experiments on the generated control systems showed that the proposed semi-distributed control model is more flexible, reusable and scalable than the centralized one, at the cost of a slight increase in required hardware resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For example, from fewer 10,000 amps central offices systems towards multiples of more radio base stations handling 3G networks and 48V/13W Power-over-Ethernet. These products should take a minimum amount of time to install and configure, and should have co-operation functionality, should adapt to the environment, and provide self-diagnoses and employ troubleshooting techniques to fix problems automatically. More equipment (due to decentralization); more mixing of different technologies such as 2G-3G wireless, cable, DSL, Wi-Fi and WiMAX; tougher competition; and shorter economic life makes calculations like Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment (ROI) even more important. Solutions for lowering TCO include simplified and automatic business processes - lean operations, use of technologies such as standardized element management and controller area networking, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Global Positioning System (GPS), wireless sensors and mesh networks, and zero configuration networking - intelligent infrastructure. Various alternative technologies - e.g. Bluetooth vs. ZigBee, proprietary vs. standards (SNMP and XML) have their strengths and weaknesses and require evaluation. XML for instance, has great advantages but due to space inefficiencies this technology is not yet suitable for embedded applications (e.g. power controllers). Inefficiency issues are addressed by new proposals like SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) and XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP). Along with decentralization, more automatic functionality and with progressively more wireless technologies, there is also an increased need for, and focus on, security. Wireless networks are great due to ease of deployment and use, but also pose security challenges because they are easier to breach, including unnoticed entry. Accordingly, security in authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality, and access control needs to be addressed in designing power controllers and power components."

A significant challenge in engineering self-proctoring software system is selecting a proper countermeasure while the software systems undergoes a well-planned attack. To address this challenge, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the software system as a two-player game. Modeling such interaction using game theory enables the decision-making engine to model the strategies of the attackers while considers the effect of possible defense strategies in a dynamic attack scenario. In this research work, we aim at engineering a novel decision-making framework that utilizes game theoretic techniques to select the proper mitigation against an attack. The introduced framework consists of three high-level phases including: modeling quality goal, designing game-theoretic techniques, and realizing the decision-making engine. The first phase models the security goals of the system and maps goal-oriented model to the designed game-theoretic technique. Such goal model makes the decision-making engine capable of tracking the satisfaction of modeled goals before and after applying a mitigation strategy. The framework provides the steps to map the goal-oriented model to any game-theoretic techniques that is suitable to model the countermeasure selection."

These approaches have to solve complex optimization problems at run time, and even though they have been shown to be suitable for different kinds of systems, their time complexity can make them excessively slow for systems that have a large adaptation-relevant state space, or that require a tight control loop driven by fast decisions. In this paper we present an approach to speed up complex proactive latency-aware self-adaptation decisions, using the cross-entropy (CE) method for combinatorial optimization. The CE method is an any-time algorithm based on random sampling from the solution space, and is not guaranteed to find an optimal solution. Nevertheless, our experiments using two very different systems show that in practice it finds solutions that are close to optimum even when its running time is restricted to a fraction of a second, attaining speedups of up to 40 times over the previous fastest solution approach."

With this in mind, we propose a strongly biomimetic model of visual perception within a novel framework for human sensorimotor control. Our framework features a biomechanically simulated, musculoskeletal human model actuated by numerous skeletal muscles, with two human-like eyes whose retinas have spatially nonuniform distributions of photoreceptors not unlike biological retinas. The retinal photoreceptors capture the scene irradiance that reaches them, which is computed using ray tracing. Within the sensory subsystem of our model, which continuously operates on the photoreceptor outputs, are 10 automatically-trained, deep neural networks (DNNs). A pair of DNNs drive eye and head movements, while the other 8 DNNs extract the sensory information needed to control the arms and legs. Thus, exclusively by means of its egocentric, active visual perception, our biomechanical virtual human learns, by synthesizing its own training data, efficient, online visuomotor control of its eyes, head, and limbs to perform tasks involving the foveation and visual pursuit of target objects coupled with visually-guided reaching actions to intercept the moving targets."

In contrast to previous work, our approach incorporates (a) temporal information during decision making, (b) multi-modal information about the environment, as well as the proprioceptive state and steering actions of the controlled vehicle, and (c) information about the uncertainty inherent to the task. To this end, we discuss Deep Predictive Models and present an implementation using a Bayesian Convolutional LSTM.

Detecting and tracking a vehicle's lane position on the road assists in lane-level navigation. For instance, it would be important to know whether a vehicle is in the correct lane for safely making a turn, perhaps even alerting the driver in advance if it is not, or whether the vehicle's speed is compliant with a lane-specific speed limit. Recent efforts have used road network information and inertial sensors to estimate lane position. While inertial sensors can detect lane shifts over short windows, it would suffer from error accumulation over time. In this paper we present DeepLane, a system that leverages the back camera of a windshield-mounted smartphone to provide an accurate estimate of the vehicle's current lane. We employ a deep learning based technique to classify the vehicle's lane position. DeepLane does not depend on any infrastructure support such as lane markings and works even when there are no lane markings, a characteristic of many roads in developing regions. We perform extensive evaluation of DeepLane on real world datasets collected in developed and developing regions. DeepLane can detect vehicle's lane position with an accuracy of over 90% in both day and night conditions.

We show that well-known reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be adapted to learn robust control policies capable of imitating a broad range of example motion clips, while also learning complex recoveries, adapting to changes in morphology, and accomplishing userspecified goals. Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts."

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well."

Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner-case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge."

In this perspective, the architecture becomes an integrated computational and measurement artifact aimed at measuring, simulating, and controlling the runtime evolution of dependable software systems. This perspective is novel and has the promise to form a built-in support for the runtime dependability analyses, reasoning, and evaluation for many architecture-centric approaches such as product-line, service oriented, and model-driven paradigms. The contribution of this position paper is a definition of Dependable Dynamic Data-Driven Software Architectures (DSA), inspired by this paradigm.

Through the design of the DeLight system, we aim to establish a biofeedback-driven lighting environment that informs users about their stress level for intervention and assists them in biofeedback relaxation training. In this study, DeLight is interfaced with a heart rate variability biofeedback system with two modes for different purposes: stress intervention and relaxation assistance. We evaluated the prototype of DeLight in two user studies. The results of the first study show that DeLight has the potential for stress intervention; the HRV biofeedback through the changes of ambient light could improve a user’s awareness of stress and trigger behavioral conditioning, such as deep breathing. The results of the second study confirm that DeLight has potential as a new biofeedback interface for relaxation assistance; biofeedback through an immersive lighting environment can support physiological regulation as effectively as graphic biofeedback; it offers enhanced relaxation effects regarding both subjective experience and physiological arousal. These findings suggest that the biofeedback-driven ambient light can perform as persuasive technology in the domain of health self-management. The combination of decorative and informative aspects enables the lighting interface to offer the users a comfortable and relaxing condition for biofeedback-assisted relaxation training."

Most of currently existing vehicular testbeds and simulators are designed to reproduce with high fidelity the ergonomic aspects associated with the driving experience. However, with increasing deployment of self-driving and remotely controlled or monitored vehicles, it is expected that the digital components of the driving experience will become more relevant. That is because users will be less engaged in the actual driving tasks and more involved with oversight activities. In this respect, high visual testbed fidelity becomes an important pre-requisite for supporting the design and evaluation of future interfaces. DriverSense, which is based on the hyper-realistic video game GTA V, has been developed to satisfy this need. To showcase its experimental flexibility, a set of self-driving interfaces have been implemented, including Heads-Up Display (HUDs), Augmented Reality (ARs) and directional audio."

Typically, the Simulink-based development starts with Stateflow modeling, followed by simulation, validation, and code generation mapped to physical execution platforms. However, recent trends have raised the demands of rigorous verification on safety-critical applications to prevent intrinsic development faults and improve the system dependability, which is unfortunately challenging. Even though the constructed Stateflow model and the generated code pass the validation of Simulink Design Verifier and Simulink Polyspace, respectively, the system may still fail due to some implicit defects contained in the design model (design defect) and the generated code (implementation defects). In this article, we bridge the Stateflow-basedMDD and a well-defined rigorous verification to reduce development faults. First, we develop a self-contained toolkit to translate a Stateflow model into timed automata, where major advanced modeling features in Stateflow are supported. Taking advantage of the strong verification capability of Uppaal, we can not only find bugs in Stateflow models that are missed by Simulink Design Verifier but also check more important temporal properties. Next, we customize a runtime verifier for the generated non-intrusive VHDL and C code of a Stateflow model for monitoring. The major strength of the customization is the flexibility to collect and analyze runtime properties with a pure software monitor, which offers more opportunities for engineers to achieve high reliability of the target system compared with the traditional act that only relies on Simulink Polyspace. In this way, safety-critical properties are both verified at the model level and at the consistent system implementation level with physical execution environment in consideration. We apply our approach to the development of a typical cyber-physical system-train communication controller based on the IEC standard 61375. Experiments show that more ambiguousness in the standard are detected and confirmed and more development faults and those corresponding errors that would lead to system failure have been removed. Furthermore, the verified implementation has been deployed on real trains."

Mobility, lack of central control and self-organizing nature between the UAVs are the main features of FANETs, which could expand the connectivity and extend the communication range at infrastructure-less area. On one hand, in case of disastrous situations when ordinary communication infrastructure is not available, FANETs can be used to provide a rapidly deployable, flexible, and self-managed communication network for real-time data transmission. On the other hand, connecting UAVs in ad-hoc mode in such a way to achieve a desired level of Quality-of-Service (QOS) requirements in a cost-effective manner is a daunting task. At the moment complex, expensive and unreliable wireless communication protocols at MAC layer are practiced. However, to enable FANETs system ubiquitous, it is necessary to have a reliable, simple and cost-effective MAC protocols. This paper introduces a novel idea of employing both IEEE 802.15.1 and IEEE 802.11 for multilayer FANETs scenarios. In this approach, data transmission between the member UAVs is done by deploying a low cost and simple 802.15.1, whereas the backbone UAVs will be connected using 802.11 MAC protocol. The proposed scheme considerably reduces communication budget and optimizes network performance. The simulation results also authenticate that the proposed MAC protocols could significantly increase the performance of flying ad hoc networks in terms of delay and throughput."

The approach is further demonstrated in adaptive robot control. Stationary and known objects are first removed from the scene for efficient detection of obstacles in a monitored area.

The data inputted to the system is a point cloud obtained from a 3D-LIDAR mounted on board an instrumented vehicle, which is transformed to a Dense-depth Map (DM). The proposed solution starts by removing ground points followed by point cloud segmentation. Then, segmented obstacles (object hypotheses) are projected onto the DM. Bounding boxes are fitted to the segmented objects as vehicle hypotheses (the HG step). Finally, the bounding boxes are used as inputs to a ConvNet to classify/verify the hypotheses of belonging to the category 'vehicle' (the HV step). In this paper, we present an evaluation of ConvNet using LIDAR-based DMs and also the impact of domain-specific data augmentation on vehicle detection performance.

In the co-existence model, it is essential for autonomous systems to’understand’ the behavior and gazing patterns of the drivers across different road turns and traffic lights. It is essential to understand that each road turn in a city is different due to angle of turn, building environment, etc. Hence, one needs to understand the gaze patterns of drivers across different turns and traffic lights. This paper is a long-drawn effort for measuring driver’s observability and deriving driver’s observance pattern in real-time. In this regard, an experimental model is provided and clustering-based technique is applied that would measure driver observability. More than 100 segmented readings were extracted from the video of five different vehicles and drivers under two different road conditions. It was observed that - while taking left or right turns and waiting in traffic light, the focus of drivers in front of their cars also changes considerably, with significant variation in the driver’s gaze point, both horizontally and vertically. This is a important pattern/result in the design of adaptive driver assistance system and future driverless cars."

For the development of a highly automated driving control algorithm, motion planning is necessary to satisfy driving condition in various road traffic situations. There are two key issues in motion planning of automated driving vehicles. One of the key issues is how to handle potentially dangerous situations that could occur in order to guarantee the safety of vehicles. The second key issue is how to guarantee the disturbance rejection of the controller under model uncertainties and external disturbances. To improve safety with respect to the future behaviors of subject vehicles, not the current states but rather the predicted behaviors of surrounding vehicles should be considered. The desired driving mode and a safe driving envelope are determined based on the probabilistic prediction of surrounding vehicles behaviors over a finite prediction horizon. To obtain the desired steering angle and longitudinal acceleration for maintaining the subject vehicle in the safe driving envelope during a finite prediction horizon, a motion planning controller is designed based on an model predictive control (MPC) approach. The developed control algorithm has been successfully implemented on a vehicle electronic control unit (ECU). The proposed control algorithm has been evaluated on a real-time vehicle traffic simulator. The throttle, brake, and steering control inputs and the controlled vehicle behavior have been compared to those of manual driving."

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The diffusion of electric vehicles suffers from immature and expensive battery technologies. Repurposing electric vehicle batteries for second-life application scenarios may lower the vehicles’ total costs of ownership and increases their ecologic sustainability. However, identifying the best–or even a feasible–scenario for which to repurpose a battery is a complex and unresolved decision problem. In this exaptation research, we set out to design, implement, and evaluate the first decision support system that aids decision-makers in the automobile industry with repurposing electric vehicle batteries. The exaptation is done by classifying decisions on repurposing products as bipartite matching problems and designing two binary integer linear programs that identify (a) all technical feasible assignments and (b) optimal assignments of products and scenarios. Based on an empirical study and expert interviews, we parameterize both binary integer linear programs for repurposing electric vehicle batteries. In a field experiment, we show that our decision support system considerably increases the decision quality in terms of hit rate, miss rate, precision, fallout, and accuracy. While practitioners can use the implemented decision support system when repurposing electric vehicle batteries, other researchers can build on our results to design decision support systems for repurposing further products."

The desired time domain specification of output Y(s) is represented as a step response of a second order system with designer specific desired damping ratio (ζ) and natural frequency (ωn). The problem of finding the unknown parameters of PID controllers is formulated in a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization frame in which the objective is to minimize the difference between the response of the designed closed-loop system and that of the desired closed-loop system. This procedure has been illustrated for achieving the desired time domain specification for WMR, taking different settling time of output response. The interaction analyses are carried out using the concept of Relative Gain Array (RGA). The RGA for both the desired and designed closed-loop systems are found to be matching. It has shown that interaction parameter λ controls both the steady-state and transient response of the desired closed-loop system. The interaction parameter also acts as a parameter which controls the coupling and is chosen by the designer as a specification to be met by the designed closed-loop system with PID controller."

Crop failure is reduced compared to traditional farming. Moreover, with automation, production of crops increases. In the proposed system, a cart rail robot is used to automate different farming tasks. Unlike a conventional system that usually uses rack and pinion or is limited to 1 Degree Of Freedom(DOF) motion, the proposed system uses a cable that actuates the entire motion of the cart providing 2 DOF motion. It works like a Cartesian robot; the motion of the cart is constrained to the XY plane and further constrained to the rail. The paper describes the mechanical design, state-space modeling and analysis of the cart-rail robot. The rails are laid out in columns with a single row. Vertical shelves stacked with crops are kept beside the column rails. A closed loop linear feedback controller was designed using state-space representation and the gains were selected using pole placement method.

In this paper, special attention was given to reduce the height of the robot chassis for given sphere size, by proposing a chassis which holds most of the electronics and gear mechanism in which stepping motor shaft is connected to axis of the omnidirectional wheel in perpendicular to each other, without sacrificing the omnidirectional traverse and pivot around its vertical axis capabilities. A bevel gear mechanism is used to drive the wheels from the stepper motors. Due to reduced chassis height, the overall height of robot is reduced to 320mm for sphere size of 240mm diameter, and has increased stability of robot due to lower center of mass. The designed robot has been simulated using SimMechanics, physical modeling method and tested in sphere over robot experimental setup which has been fabricated. The feasibility of developing the mechanism, kinematics and highlights of fabricated robot are described in this paper."

In recent days, a prominent example for these systems are autonomously driving vehicles that continuously have to sense their environment to calculate the next set points for their control algorithms. The development of these complex and interconnected systems requires the combined utilization of simulations and test-runs in reality to assess the system's quality and to increase the developer's and customer's confidence in the resulting implementation. The combination of interactive as well as unattended simulated system tests has to be in tight coordination with their real counterparts to derive reliable results on the one hand and to save valuable resources on the other hand. In this article, the development and test processes of two autonomously driving vehicles are analyzed to derive essential design drivers for a domain-specific language to unify the description, evaluation, and mutual feedback of simulative and real test-runs.

This paper presents the design of a compact low-cost ROV for river exploration with a modular structure. The ROV is neutrally buoyant which increases its efficiency. The ROV uses three thrusters for its movement inside water and has 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). A detailed 3D model is developed using SOLIDWORKS and stress analysis has been carried out to ensure it will not fail under hydrodynamic pressure. Hydrodynamic characteristics are studied using ANSYS FLUENT, which helps in determining the maximum thrust required for the vehicle propulsion and the maximum achievable velocity. The prototype is manufactured with glass fiber composite and fitted with different electronics components, sensors, and battery.

These diverse simulators must then be coordinated to run concurrently in order to evaluate the performance of critical infrastructures which influence each other, especially in emergency or resource-critical situations. We therefore describe the design of an adaptive communication middleware that provides reliable and real-time one-to-one and group communications for federations of CI simulators over a wide-area network (WAN). The proposed middleware is composed of mobile agent-based peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays, called virtual networks (VNets), to enable resilient, adaptive and real-time communications over unreliable and dynamic physical networks (PNets). The autonomous software agents comprising the communication middleware monitor their performance and the underlying PNet, and dynamically adapt the P2P overlay and migrate over the PNet in order to optimize communications according to the requirements of the federation and the current conditions of the PNet. Reliable communications is provided via redundancy within the communication middleware and intelligent migration of agents over the PNet. The proposed middleware integrates security methods in order to protect the communication infrastructure against attacks and provide privacy and anonymity to the participants of the federation. Experiments with an initial version of the communication middleware over a real-life networking testbed show that promising improvements can be obtained for unicast and group communications via the agent migration capability of our middleware. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The purpose of this study was to analyze and plan the introducing of service robotics, Pepper for catering services. Service blueprint analyzes and expert interview were conducted in the study. The service process of a certain restaurant, ikki, was analyzed and the current service blueprint was developed firstly. Then, a series of in-depth interviews respectively with the information expert, brand developer, store manager and customers were conducted to find out how much they know and how they feel about service robots. Simultaneously, what part of the service process can be assigned to the robot and when the task can be introduced were discussed. Finally, a service blueprint with service robots introduced at short-term, med-term and long-term stage for the specific restaurant was proposed. The result indicated that the service robot, Pepper, can mainly be applied at welcoming, reception, booking confirmation, festival celebration, and thanks for coming in the short-term stage. In the medium-term, Pepper carrying a tablet could be applied to order meal, integrating with the electronic booking system, and Pepper for Biz application to record customer behavior. The reception work should be replaced and the usher function was introduced with the mobile service robot Pepper in the long-term stage.

Few have addressed the coating variability caused by normal processing tolerances and the variability at the end-of-life after environmental exposure in orbit. For critical thermal designs, this information is required by the thermal designer. The purpose of this paper was to collect design information used for conducting thermal analyses for the thermal control coatings used by Product Group I of the International Space Station Alpha. Both nominal values and manufacturing tolerances are listed for the beginning-of-life and for the end-of-life of the coating. In assessing the end-of-life values, McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (MDA) took into account contaminant deposition on the coatings and the influence of the natural environments on the deposited contamination layer. Because of the eroding effects of atomic oxygen on organic materials, most coatings selected were inorganic, including Z-93, conversion coatings, anodic coatings, and metal tubing with and without plating. Silicone-based paints and silverized Teflon were used for a few specific applications. This paper provides design information and tables for each of the coating categories defined and can serve as a convenient design reference for the thermal designer. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach (N=20) and a survey (N=413) to infer design elements for workplace self-monitoring, which we then implemented as a technology probe called WorkAnalytics. We field-tested these design elements during a three-week study with software development professionals (N=43). Based on the results of the field study, we present design recommendations for self-monitoring in the workplace, such as using experience sampling to increase the awareness about work and to create richer insights, the need for a large variety of different metrics to retrospect about work, and that actionable insights, enriched with benchmarking data from co-workers, are likely needed to foster productive behavior change and improve collaboration at work.

The design is inspired from the knifefish. The propulsion system is based on the undulating fins. A simplified model of the fins is constructed by using oscillating servomotors to which are attached cranks holding flexible membranes that can slide permitting the variation of the length of the fins. The depth control was inspired from the gas bladder of fish which changes volume to control the depth based on the buoyancy forces. A buoyancy tank, equipped with two pistons, is used to change the submerged volume. Proximity sensors are used to monitor and limit the piston movement. The robot fish was controlled using microprocessors which takes readings from proximity, depth and pitch sensors, and implements a control scheme. Bluetooth technology was used to interface the robot fish to a laptop to allow the operator to control the robot fish. The propulsion speed was measured as a function of phase angle and a frequency of the servomotors. Testing has also been conducted in an outdoor diving pool to demonstrate the capability of the knifefish robot in various swimming courses and also the depth control of the bio-fish 4m under the water. The design structures and mechanisms can be scaled down for micro-bio-fish models. The micro-fin model driven by a smart actuator is being tested. The bio-mechatronics implementation can be applied in defence and medical applications as the model is modular, scalable, and re-configurable."

This mobile device is capable of recording the data traffic of automotive-specific bus systems like Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), FlexRay and Media Orientied Systems Transport (MOST) in real-time. In order to accelerate the subsequent analysis of the tremendous amount of data, it is advisable to pre-filter the recorded log data on device, during the test-drive. To enable the test engineer of creating data analyses we built a component-based library on top of the languages SystemC/C++. Problematic with this approach is that still substantial programming knowledge is required for implementing filter algorithms, which is usually not the domain of a vehicle test engineer. In a next step we developed a graphical modelling language on top of our library and a graphical editor. The editor is able of verifying a model as well as of generating source code which eliminates the need of manually implementing a filter algorithm. In our contribution we show the design of the graphical language and the editor using the Eclipse platform and the Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF). We describe the automatic extraction of meta-information, such as available components, their interfaces and categorization annotations by parsing the library's C++ implementation with the help of Xtext.

Solutions are expected to be efficient, flexible, reusable on rapidly evolving hardware and of course at low cost. Model driven approaches can be very helpful for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a study associating model-driven technology and component-based development. This work is illustrated by the realization of a use case from aerospace industry that has fault-tolerance requirements: a launch vehicle. UML based modeling is used to capture application structure and related non-functional requirements thanks to the profiles CCM (CORBA Component Model) and QoS&FT (Quality of Service and Fault Tolerance). The application model is enriched with infrastructure component dedicated to fault-tolerance. From this model we generate CCM descriptor files which in turns are used to build bootcode (static deployment) which instantiates, configures and connects components.

Our agent, named Robota, combines chat-based communication as a Slack Bot and voice interaction through a personal device using a custom Amazon Alexa Skill. Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work.

All rights reserved.Household level rooftop solar technology adoption is rising in many regions, driven by a multitude of factors, including falling prices and incentives such as tax breaks. It has also been shown in recent research that peer effects have an important role in the spread of solar adoption. This leads to a natural problem of how to design incentives to maximize adoption in such a model. While this is an instance of an ""influence maximization"" problem, prior results from the influence maximization literature cannot be used directly. In this work, we extend prior results from the literature on the use of submodularity to obtain a greedy approximation. We use this new result to do optimal ""seed set"" selection for a highly detailed, data-driven, agent-based model of household rooftop solar adoption."

A physically active lifestyle is crucial for the successful management of the disease. Pervasive technology such as activity trackers can make patients more aware of their physical activity (PA), and help clinicians in getting an objective view of their patients’ lifestyle. We developed a web application called FitViz which gathers data from an arthritis patient’s Fitbit device and allows her clinician to use this data in setting personalized goals for the patient. We conducted a pilot study with 10 knee Osteoarthritis patients and 10 Rheumatoid Arthritis patients to test the feasibility of the application. 11 participants were interviewed to share their experiences after using FitViz for a month. The use of pervasive technology — Fitbit and FitViz — increased PA awareness, and helped in realistic goal-setting. Participants expressed different emotions — including mistrust in technology — concerning goal achievement. We use these findings to draw design implications for future pervasive technologies for arthritis patients."

We adopt an architectural pattern based on the Agents and Artefacts (A&A) metamodel: self-organisation mechanisms are added to an existing environment of artefacts by embedding them into environmental agents. We rely on a three-stage design approach with modelling, simulation and tuning, so as to identify a suitable design of environmental agents and their interaction with artefacts. The main objective is to design a MAS environment providing services that self-organise in response to the unpredictable dynamics of the agents exploiting them. As a case study, we analyse the problem called collective sorting, a service for decentralised sorting of items in MAS environments that was inspired by social insects' behaviour: the proposed solution features environmental agents and tuple spaces, whose design choices and evaluation have been driven by formal simulations.

Distributed development and testing on a common hardware platform require remote and anytime accessibility paired with a respective resource management, high operability of the robot including quality management and easy deployment of new software components. In the present article a web-based integration platform for distributed development and test is presented that aims at providing an integrated solution for these requirements.

Despite RVs’ robustness against natural disturbances, cyber or physical attacks against RVs may lead to physical malfunction and subsequently disruption or failure of the vehicles’ missions. To avoid or mitigate such consequences, it is essential to develop attack detection techniques for RVs. In this paper, we present a novel attack detection framework to identify external, physical attacks against RVs on the fly by deriving and monitoring Control Invariants (CI). More specifically, we propose a method to extract such invariants by jointly modeling a vehicle’s physical properties, its control algorithm and the laws of physics. These invariants are represented in a state-space form, which can then be implemented and inserted into the vehicle’s control program binary for runtime invariant check. We apply our CI framework to eleven RVs, including quadrotor, hexarotor, and ground rover, and show that the invariant check can detect three common types of physical attacks - including sensor attack, actuation signal attack, and parameter attack - with very low runtime overhead."

On the other hand, automatic, data-driven personality detection raises privacy concerns due to a need for excessive personal data. We present an unobtrusive method for detecting personality within the workplace that combines a user’s online and offline behaviors. We report insights from analyzing data collected from four different workplaces with 37 participants, which shows that complementing online and offline data allows a more complete reflection of an individual’s personality. We also present possible applications of unobtrusive personality detection in the workplace."

An analysis of these technologies shows them all to employ the principle of the separation of concerns, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and Component-based Software Development (CBSD) for building high quality of software systems. In general, the ultimate goal of these technologies is to be able to reduce development costs and effort, while improving the adaptability, and dependability of software systems. COSD, has emerged as a generic development paradigm towards constructing self-adaptive software by integrating MDA with context-oriented component model. The self-adaptive applications are developed using a Context- Oriented Component-based Applications Model-Driven Architecture (COCA-MDA), which generates an Architecture Description language (ADL) presenting the architecture as a componentsbased software system. COCA-MDA enables the developers to modularise the application based on their context-dependent behaviours, and separate the context-dependent functionality from the context-free functionality of the application. In this article, we wish to study the impact of the decomposition mechanism performed in MDA approaches over the software self-adaptability. We argue that a better and significant advance in software modularity based on context information can increase software adaptability and increase their performance and modifiability. © 2012 IEEE."

We tackle this challenging and rarely addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual as well as geometric cues. To utilize the appearance and contextual cues, we propose a new deep learning-based obstacle detection framework. Here a variant of a fully convolutional network is proposed to predict a pixel-wise semantic labeling of (i) free-space, (ii) on-road unexpected obstacles, and (iii) background. The geometric cues are exploited using a state-of-The-Art detection approach that predicts obstacles from stereo input images via model-based statistical hypothesis tests. We present a principled Bayesian framework to fuse the semantic and stereo-based detection results. The mid-level Stixel representation is used to describe obstacles in a flexible, compact and robust manner. We evaluate our new obstacle detection system on the Lost and Found dataset, which includes very challenging scenes with obstacles of only 5 cm height. Overall, we report a major improvement over the state-of-The-Art, with a performance gain of 27.4%. In particular, we achieve a detection rate of over 90% for distances of up to 50 m. Our system operates at 22 Hz on our self-driving platform."

Our uniform modelling paradigm is logic-labelled finite-state machines (LLFSMs). Behaviours are constructed by parameterizable, loadable, and suspendable LLFSMs executed in predictable sequential schedules, but they are also verified at run-time by LLFSMs as well. Our architecture enables runtime verification (to monitor the quality of software during execution) as well as set up, tear down, and enforcement of quality behaviour during runtime. The LLFSMs models are executable and efficient because they are compiled (not interpreted). The LLFSMs can be derived from requirement engineering approaches such as behaviour trees, and also validated using test-driven development. However, in situations where software evolves incorporating elements of adaptive systems or machine learning, the software in execution may have never existed during development. We demonstrate the features of the architecture with illustrative case studies from robotics and embedded systems."

We provide a description of how this is implemented in a driving simulator using Unity, a game engine. In addition, we report preliminary results. Overall, we found that participants were more aroused and cautious under conditions of low environment visibility, even though visibility had no bearing on the likelihood of vehicle automation to fail.

This perception is reinforced by contemporary methods and component technologies, which typically view components as merely ""binary-level"" modules with little relevance beyond the implementation and deployment phases of development. The authors present a method known as KobrA that embraces the component concept at all phases of the software life-cycle, and allows high-level components (described in the UML) to be implemented using conventional software development approaches, as well as the latest component technologies (e.g. JavaBeans, CORBA, COM). The approach therefore provides a practical vehicle for applying the component paradigm within the context of a model driven architecture.

Development of an android application in kannada to enhance picture naming skills in persons with aphasia,"Shenoy, Rajath;Nayak, Sudhindra;Hegde, Mahendra Kumar;Kini, Narasimha;Kundapur, Poornima Panduranga;Krishnan, Gopee","2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)",2017,IEEE,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,"2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI 2017",2017-11-30,10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8126161,2-s2.0-85042666888,Aphasia | Mobile based rehabilation | Monitoring,"© 2017 IEEE.Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in India, and the prevalence of this disorder shows a steep rise in the recent decades. Among the many consequences of stroke, the loss of the ability to use language - i.e., aphasia - is a major detriment to the quality of life of the affected individuals. In the recent past, the rise of modeldriven treatment approaches has shown promising effects in persons with aphasia. Two such techniques to enhance naming are the Semantic Feature Analysis and Phonological Component Analysis techniques. These two techniques focus on entirely different constructs in language. The first one focuses on the semantic or conceptual training, whereas, the second focuses on the sound-based training in patients with naming difficulties after stroke-Aphasia. Despite the availability of such effective techniques, a major constraint is the availability of trained personnel to provide such training to the needy persons who reside far from the clinical facilities. Present day technological advances may fill this lacuna. Method: Preparation of training set by using phonological component analysis technique for naming considering psycholinguistic properties such as familiarity and imagibility of words was done. A set of 150 words was subjected for rating by nine individuals. Considering the best rating among these raters, the final 100 set was selected for training items in android platform. The android application was developed (MAT-APP naming module one) using Android Studio for designing the user interface. MySQL is used as the backend database. To ensure monitoring of patient performance the MAT-APP has an interface with a web application. Results: We expect that android application considering theoretical aspects of language processing can provide a potential value in distant rehabilitation and also better service delivery in various problems mentioned in literature."

The internal agent behavior and the interaction within the agent organizations become even more complex and hard to implement when the requirements and interactions for the other agent environments such as the Semantic Web are considered. Hence, in this study, we propose a modeldriven MAS development methodology which is based on a domain-specific modeling language (called SEA_ML) and covers the whole process of analysis, modeling, code generation and implementation of a MAS working in the Semantic Web according to the well-known Belief-Desire- Intention (BDI) agent principles. The use of new SEA_ML-based MAS development methodology is exemplified with the development of a semantic web-enabled MAS for electronic bartering (Ebarter). Achieved results validated the generation and the development-time performance of applying this new MAS development methodology. More than half of the all agents and artifacts needed for fully implementing the E-barter MAS were automatically obtained by just using the generation features of the proposed methodology."

Its developments usually require testing protoypes with real users in Living Labs (LL). This makes projects expensive. Virtual LLs (VLLs) try to address theses issues by using simulations for requirements elicitation and the initial testing of solutions. These simulations frequently require considering social aspects, e.g. relationships, culture, or decision making. These are recurrent and quite application-independent aspects for AAL. Our work proposes social properties as patterns that represent these aspects and that can be plugged-in in simulations. The knowledge for these properties is extracted following the Activity Theory (AT) paradigm from Social Sciences. Their specification uses models and transformations (e.g. to generate other models or code) following Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices. This faciliates their understading and use in simulation development. A case study on AAL for ageing illustrates the approach."

The aim of this study was to examine whether specific biomarkers of PTSD predict treatment success in trauma-focused psychotherapy. Methods Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial comparing two forms of trauma-focused psychotherapy. Basal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and the response to the dexamethasone suppression test were assessed pre-treatment in 24 PTSD patients. Treatment success was measured by pre- to post-treatment decrease in self-reported PTSD severity. Results A more suppressed cortisol curve after dexamethasone significantly predicted greater PTSD symptom decrease in trauma-focused psychotherapy, independent of the effects of gender, pre-treatment PTSD symptom severity, and trauma history. Basal early morning cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate did not predict treatment response. Limitations The number of participants who completed the neuroendocrine measurements was small and a significant number of participants fulfilled criteria of co-morbid major depressive disorder. Conclusions This study suggests the use of the dexamethasone-suppression test for the cortisol awakening response as a biomarker for treatment response to trauma-focused psychotherapy. Measures of HPA-axis sensitivity appear to be an important predictor of positive clinical response in PTSD patients, and may lead to biomarker-based treatment matching in the future."

It happens that in practice such models tend to need too much space to be efficiently processed. By opposition, symbolic approaches offer an expressive, easy and concise way to model systems, and checking diagnosability from such symbolic models can benefit from this reduction of space complexity. Indeed, though this will generally translate into time complexity, such a tradeoff is advantageous, as diagnosability checking is something that is usually done at design stage. This is why this paper proposes a theoretical framework to check diagnosability of Input Output Symbolic Transition Systems (IOSTS) by adapting the twin plant approach to the symbolic case and relying on the use of a symbolic model checker. This theoretical work is being currently applied to embedded functions inside a vehicle in the context of an industrial project and a simplified version of this problem will serve as a running example throughout the presentation. © 2009 IEEE."

Several representational approaches for the preparation of domain content and learning support have been developed. However, for the context-sensitive design of interactive artifacts not only the representation of particular aspects of learning is essential, but rather the propagation of didactic knowledge to functional services and interaction facilities. Such an endeavor requires the explicit representation of relationships between structure and behavior elements. Model-driven design supports the distinctive representation of multiple perspectives while allowing the mutually tuned refinement of design elements. In this paper a model-based approach for self-organized e-learning is presented. It supports the design of learner-centered knowledge acquisition by specifying user roles and learning tasks. We discuss the required enrichments of traditional model-based design approaches, due to the consistent tuning of high-level design elements, and the coherent propagation of task and user information to interaction services. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

In our application of this technology, an evolving population of digital organisms is subjected to natural selection, where organisms are rewarded for generating state diagrams that support key scenarios and satisfy critical properties as specified by the developer. To achieve this capability, we extended the AVIDA digital evolution platform to enable state diagram generation, and integrated AVIDA with third-party software engineering tools, e.g., the Spin model checker, to assess the generated state diagrams. To illustrate this approach, we successfully applied it to the generation of state diagrams describing the autonomous navigation behavior of a humanoid robot. © 2008 IEEE."

Mobile robotics, Geographic Information Systems, intelligent personal assistants as well as database querying applications are required to automatically and accurately interpret such expressions, called Approximate Numerical Expressions (ANE). The main challenge is to determine their numerical boundaries that sound plausible to users. The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines to mterpret ANEs that are mdependent from the domain and the formal representations. We identified three arithmetical properties and exammed their involvement in ANE interpretation as mtervals of denoted values. The implicit assumption of symmetry of the mtervals was also tested. To do so, 146 participants were asked to provide the mteivals corresponding to 24 ANEs in a semantically neutral context. Results suggest that the properties of ANEs we identified are key factors in their interpretation while symmetry is not always maintained. This study contributes towards an imderstandmg of how users process ANEs and its results can be used to improve intelligent mterfaces that lead to better users' satisfaction and natural interaction between him/her and the system."

The key feature of our method is that it employs fluid displacements as the shape sensor. Unlike optical sensors, the liquid has no line-of-sight requirements, it penetrates cavities and hidden parts of the object, as well as transparent and glossy materials, thus bypassing all visibility and optical limitations of conventional scanning devices. Our new scanning approach is implemented using a dipping robot arm and a bath of water, via which it measures the water elevation. We show results of reconstructing complex 3D shapes and evaluate the quality of the reconstruction with respect to the number of dips."

However obtaining such labeled data in real home scenarios could be prohibitive due to either the privacy concerns of using cameras, or the low adherence of self reports done by home residents. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, aims at discovering activities through applying xed complexity models, yet assuming apriori knowledge of the number of activities. Again this is also a non-practical approach because the number of activities could vary drastically, even within a home. In this paper, we propose a novel practical unsupervised Bayesian nonparametric model to discover activities in smart homes, without prior assumption on the number of activities. Instead, our model can automatically infer such number only from sensor readings, thus it can be easily applied to any new home. We test our method on a public dataset and a dataset collected in our project. On the CASAS dataset, which has activity labels, our approach can achieve the performance close to the best of GMM and outperforms K-means. On our smart home dataset, the discovered activities are highly correlated with the typical daily routine of the resident. Such experimental results demonstrate the eciency of our method for activity discovery in smart homes."

However, meaningfully associating these two sources of data with each other is difficult: while it is natural for human beings to reflect on their experience in terms of remembered episodes, it is an open challenge to retrace this subjective organization in sensor data referencing objective time. Lifelogging is a specific approach to the ubiquitous monitoring of individuals that can contribute to overcoming this recollection gap. It strives to create a comprehensive timeline of semantic annotations that reflect the impressions of the monitored person from his or her own subjective point-of-view. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for processing such lifelogs to situate remembered experiences in an objective timeline. It involves the computational modeling of individuals’ memory processes to estimate segments within a lifelog acting as plausible digital representations for their recollections. We report about an empirical investigation in which we use our approach to discover plausible representations for remembered social interactions between participants in a longitudinal study. In particular, we describe an exploration of the behavior displayed by our model for memory processes in this setting. Finally, we explore the representations discovered for this study and discuss insights that might be gained from them."

The discovered hidden features are translated into human understandable competencies by matching the computed values to expert input.

Deploying a radio observatory in space would open up this largely unexplored frequency band for science in astronomy, cosmology, geophysics, and space science. A Chinese-European team is proposing an ultra long wavelength (ULW) radio interferometer mission DSL (Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelengths). The proposed radio interferometer will be deployed in low-altitude lunar orbit, exploiting the radio quietness of the lunar far side. DSL will consist of a mother-spacecraft for data transport and control, plus eight small micro-satellites each equipped with three orthogonal dipoles. These satellites form a virtual distributed observatory with adjustable baselines, allowing different scientific observation strategies. The satellites are configured in a flexible quasi-linear array in nearly identical orbits, guaranteeing low relative drift rates. Short orbital periods and orbit precession ensure quick filling of the interferometric spatial frequency (u, v, w) space, enabling high quality imaging. The science themes considered for the DSL mission include pioneering studies of the unknown and exploratory science such as the search for signatures of the cosmological Dark Ages, complementing current (e.g. LOFAR) and future SKA telescope searches; full-sky continuum survey of discrete sources, including ultra-steep spectrum extragalactic sources, pulsars, and transients (galactic and extragalactic); full-sky map of continuum diffuse emission; solar-terrestrial physics, planetary sciences, and cosmic ray physics. The main frequency band covered is 1-30 MHz extending down to 0.1 MHz, and up to about 50 MHz for cross-referencing with ground-based instruments.

Based on SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) attributes, many researchers derive disk failure prediction models using machine learning techniques. Despite the significant developments, the majority of works rely on offline training and thereby hinder their adaption to the continuous update of forthcoming data, suffering from the ‘model aging’ problem. We are therefore motivated to uncover the root cause – the dynamic SMART distribution for ‘model aging’, aiming to resolve the performance degradation as to pave a comprehensive study in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel disk failure prediction model using Online Random Forests (ORFs). Our ORF-based model can automatically evolve with sequential arrival of data on-the-fly and thus is highly adaptive to the variance of SMART distribution over time. Moreover, it has favourable advantage against the offline counterparts in terms of superior prediction performance. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our ORF model converges rapidly to the offline random forests and achieves stable failure detection rates of 93-99% with low false alarm rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach on maintaining stable prediction performance for the long-term usage in data centers."

In this problem, n robots are placed in an n node graph arbitrarily and must coordinate with each other to reach a final configuration such that exactly one robot is at each node. We study this problem through the lenses of minimizing the memory required by each robot and of minimizing the number of rounds required to achieve dispersion. Dispersion is of interest due to its relationship to the problems of scattering on a graph, exploration using mobile robots, and load balancing on a graph. Additionally, dispersion has an immediate real world application due to its relationship to the problem of recharging electric cars, as each car can be considered a robot and recharging stations and the roads connecting them nodes and edges of a graph respectively. Since recharging is a costly affair relative to traveling, we want to distribute these cars amongst the various available recharge points where communication should be limited to car-To-car interactions. We provide lower bounds on both the memory required for robots to achieve dispersion and the minimum running time to achieve dispersion on any type of graph. We then analyze the trade-offs between time and memory for various types of graphs. We provide time optimal and memory optimal algorithms for several types of graphs and show the power of a little memory in terms of running time."
Dissociation of performance parameters at the \IAT\ requires specific exercise recommendations for depressed patients,"Donath, Lars;Boettger, Silke;Puta, Christian;Wetzig, Franziska;Mueller, Hans Josef;Bär, Karl Jürgen;Gabriel, Holger H.W.",Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2010,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,2010-01-20,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.10.012,2-s2.0-73649092073,Aerobic exercise training | Exercise intensity determination | Heart rate reserve | Individual anaerobic threshold | Maximal heart rate | Peak oxygen consumption,"Aerobic exercise training is considered an adequate complementary treatment strategy for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is a need for comparative methodological investigations to determine the appropriate exercise intensity for these patients. The study compared submaximal exercise intensity determination with those derived from maximal parameters such as percentages of heart rate reserve (HRR), maximal heart rate (HRmax) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) of patients and controls. An exhaustive incremental bicycle exercise test was completed by 15 female MDD patients and matched controls. The individual anaerobic lactate threshold (IAT) as a gold standard to determine individual aerobic exercise intensity was assessed according to Stegmann and coworkers. Exercise intensities at 70 and 85% of HRmax, 70 and 85% of HRR and 50 to 80% of VO2peak were compared to the IAT. Patients suffering from MDD switched earlier to anaerobic metabolism than matched healthy controls. But interestingly, the level of self-rated perceived exertion, concentration of lactate, respiratory exchange ratio and heart rate at the IAT level revealed no significant difference between both groups. Due to a growing number of clinical aerobic exercise treatments in depressive disorders exercise intensities > 70% of (a) HRmax, (b) HRR, (c) VO2peak should be amended by the IAT and Borg scale measurements to avoid over challenging as well as increased anaerobic metabolism. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

With the goal to speed up planning time, we introduce a learning approach to approximate the distance metric for RRT-based planners. By exploiting a novel steer function which solves the two-point boundary value problem for wheeled mobile robots, we train a simple nonlinear parametric model with constant-time inference that is shown to predict distances accurately in terms of regression and ranking performance. In an extensive analysis we compare our approach to an Euclidean distance baseline, consider four alternative regression models and study the impact of domain-specific feature expansion. The learning approach is shown to be faster in planning time by several factors at negligible loss of path quality."

In contrast to current implementations of a body camera that use a power-hungry default configuration and can only be turned on and off by an officer, we propose an idea that the camera should be autonomous and active all the time. By leveraging the information from an on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU), these autonomous cameras should dynamically adjust their configuration in order to keep the device under the desired energy budget. To enable such a system, we propose a distributed adaptive model predictive controller for a system of body cameras, which allows the collaboration between multiple cameras which is currently not available in existing implementations."

Such 'cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation."

As datasets increase radically in size, highly scalable LOF algorithms leveraging modern distributed infrastructures are required. This poses significant challenges due to the complexity of the LOF definition, and a lack of access to the entire dataset at any individual compute machine. Our solution features a distributed LOF pipeline framework, called DLOF. Each stage of the LOF computation is conducted in a fully distributed fashion by leveraging our invariant observation for intermediate value management. Furthermore, we propose a data assignment strategy which ensures that each machine is self-sufficient in all stages of the LOF pipeline, while minimizing the number of data replicas. Based on the convergence property derived from analyzing this strategy in the context of real world datasets, we introduce a number of data-driven optimization strategies. These strategies not only minimize the computation costs within each stage, but also eliminate unnecessary communication costs by aggressively pushing the LOF computation into the early stages of the DLOF pipeline. Our comprehensive experimental study using both real and synthetic datasets confirms the efficiency and scalability of our approach to terabyte level data."

In this paper, we propose DLFuzz, the first differential fuzzing testing framework to guide DL systems exposing incorrect behaviors. DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality.We present empirical evaluations on two well-known datasets to demonstrate its efficiency. Compared with DeepXplore, the state-of-the-art DL whitebox testing framework, DLFuzz does not require extra efforts to find similar functional DL systems for cross-referencing check, but could generate 338.59% more adversarial inputs with 89.82% smaller perturbations, averagely obtain 2.86% higher neuron coverage, and save 20.11% time consumption."

This method avoids recording a training database in all the possible acoustic environments given an HRI scenario. Moreover, different speech recognition testing conditions were produced by recording two types of acoustics sources, i.e. a loudspeaker and human speakers, using a Microsoft Kinect mounted on top of the PR2 robot, while performing head rotations and movements towards and away from the fixed sources. In this generic HRI scenario, the resulting automatic speech recognition engine provided a word error rate that is at least 26% and 38% lower than publicly available speech recognition APIs with the playback (i.e. loudspeaker) and human testing databases, respectively, with a limited amount of training data."

We describe two novel domain-independent heuristics for goal formulation (motivators) that evaluate the utility of goals based on the projected consequences of achieving them. We then describe their integration in M-ARTUE, an agent that balances the satisfaction of internal needs with the achievement of goals introduced externally. We assess its performance in a series of experiments in the Rovers With Compass domain. Our results show that using domain-independent heuristics yields performance comparable to using domain-specific knowledge for goal formulation.

The performance is improved by using data augmentation for an advanced driver assist system (ADAS) specific to on-road object recognition. The problem of object detection is first analyzed based on a deep neural network in the ADAS domain, and then representative object detection methods that use deep neural networks are surveyed. A restricted random crop process is suggested for detecting small objects in an image, and then a patch resampling strategy is proposed for solving the long tail property in an on-road dataset. The proposed ADAS domain-specific data augmentation method is adjusted for the original object detection method based on a deep neural network. The object detection results were evaluated using an embedded board on the KITTI benchmark dataset, and the suggested data augmentation method improves the average precision by 30%."

The methodology is well suitable for situations when constructing the accurate deterministic grammar is not a trivial task or the higher flexibility is required. In the case of in-vehicle infotainment, the key idea is to decrease the cognitive load of the driver during controlling such a system and also to make designing process less time consuming. Evaluation of the proposed approach was done on the INCARSCOM corpus (Slovak In-car Command Database). Obtained results favour designed method instead of constructing the appropriate deterministic grammar."

Based on social learning theory, this study tested whether a defensive driving training program coupled with observer feedback could influence domain-specific locus of control beliefs regarding controllability of accidents and therefore impact driving behaviors. Over a 5-week period, 112 individuals' driving locus of control and driving behaviors were assessed two times, before and after a defensive driving training program and observer feedback. Drivers experienced significant changes in their driving locus of control perceptions. Specifically, drivers reported significantly lower externality and higher internality after training as compared to before training. The changes in driving locus of control predicted an increase in safe driving behaviors. In addition, pretraining motivation to learn predicted a decrease in externality, whereas pretraining self-efficacy predicted the increase in internality. The results indicate that driving locus of control can be influenced by training and observer feedback, and the changes in driving locus of control can predict change in driving behaviors. Findings of the study point to the potential for organizations to enhance driving safety by influencing drivers' locus of control perceptions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

A major challenge in DMR is to program the ensemble of robots with formal guarantees and high assurance of correct operation. To this end, we introduce Drona, a framework for building reliable DMR applications. This paper makes three central contributions: (1) We present a novel and provably correct decentralized asynchronous motion planner that can perform on-the-fly collision-free planning for dynamically generated tasks. Moreover, the motion planner is the first to take into account the fact that distributed robots may have clocks that are only synchronized up to a tolerance, i.e., they are almost synchronous; (2) We formalize the DMR system as a mixed-synchronous system, and present a sound abstraction-based verification approach for DMR systems, and (3) Drona provides a state-machine based language for safe event-driven programming of a DMR system and the code generated by the compiler can be executed on platforms such as the robot operating system (ROS). To demonstrate the efficacy of Drona, we build and verify a priority mail delivery system. Using our abstraction-based verification approach we were able to find, within a few minutes, bugs which could not be found by performing random simulation for several hours. Our verified decentralized motion-planner scales efficiently for large number of robots (upto 128 robots) and workspace sizes (upto a 256×256 grid)."

The reconstruction quality of the immersive scene representation on the device and thus the quality of user experience will depend on the signal sampling rate and location of each drone. Moreover, there is a limit on the aggregate amount of data the network can sample and relay towards the user, stemming from transmission constraints. Finally, the user navigation actions will dynamically place different priorities on specific viewpoints of the captured scene. We make multiple contributions in this context. First, we formulate the viewpoint-priority-aware scene reconstruction error as a function of the assigned sampling rates and compute their optimal values that minimize the former, for given drone positions and system constraints. Second, we design an online view sampling policy that takes actions while exploring new drone locations to discover the best drone network configuration over the scene. We characterize its approximation versus convergence characteristics using novel spectral graph analysis and show considerable advances relative to the state-of-the-art. Finally, to enable the drone sensors to efficiently communicate their data back to the aggregation point, we formulate computationally efficient ratedistortion-power optimized transmission scheduling policies that meet the low-latency application requirements, while conserving the available energy. Our experimental results demonstrate the competitive advantages of our approach over multiple performance factors. This is a first-of-its-kind study of an emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact."

Using quadcopters to provide tactile feedback, navigation, or user input are the current scope of related work. However, most quadcopter steering systems are complicated to use for non-expert users or require an expensive tracking system for autonomous flying. Safety-critical scenarios require trained and expensive personnel to navigate quadcopters through crucial flight paths within narrow spaces. To simplify the input and manual operation of quadcopters, we present DroneCTRL, a tangible pointing device to navigate quadcopters. DroneCTRL resembles a remote control including optional visual feedback by a laser pointer and tangibility to improve the quadcopter control usability for non-expert users.

We first compiled an extensive dictionary associating geographic strings (e.g., airport codes) with geophysical locations. We then searched a large set of router hostnames for these strings, assuming each autonomous naming domain uses geographic hints consistently within that domain. We used topology and performance data continually collected by our global measurement infrastructure to discern whether a given hint appears to co-locate different hostnames in which it is found. Finally, we generalized geolocation hints into domainspecific rule sets. We generated a total of 1,711 rules covering 1,398 different domains and validated them using domain-specific ground truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike previous efforts which relied on labor-intensive domain-specific manual analysis, we automate our process for inferring the domain specific heuristics, substantially advancing the state-of-the-art of methods for geolocating Internet resources."

Despite the essential benefit of the ball-robot that it cannot flip over or fall down, the robot's physical construction often severely limits the ball mobility in uneven terrain. The customarily applied quasi-static motion model makes the anticipated theoretical robot mobility even worse, because it completely ignores ball dynamics and therefore seriously under-estimates the robot's obstacle-crossing capability. The energy-based model, sometimes applied instead of the quasi-static model, over-estimates ball mobility and becomes inconvenient when an active driving motor is added to the system. This paper introduces a new extended dynamic model for flexible pendulum-driven ball-shaped robots, as well as a simulation-based method to predict the robot's step-crossing capability. The extended dynamic model allows rolling, bouncing and slipping of the robot, and it includes a simplified contact model for the ball-obstacle-interaction. The simulation results have been compared to experimental results obtained with a physical robot. The comparison shows that the new dynamic model and contact model outperform the traditionally applied quasi-static and energy-based models. The new dynamic model may be applied in mobility analysis of ball-robot designs, for path planning, as well as for control algorithm development."

In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines. DSM-capable DSL thus enables the broadband age."

To this end, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can adjust the flight altitude to increase the resolution only where needed, making non-uniform coverage strategies efficient both in time and energy expenditure. In a multi-UAV monitoring context, it is nece ssary to deploy UAVs to inspect in parallel those areas where a higher resolution is required. To address this problem, we propose a decentralised deployment strategy inspired by the collective beh aviour of honeybees. This strategy dynamically assigns UAVs to different areas to be monitored, and suitably re-assigns them to other areas when needed. We introduce an analytical macroscopic model of area monitoring from UAVs. and we propose a paramet erisation that leads to an efficient allocation of UAVs to the areas to be monitored. We exploit abstract multi-agent simulations to study the dynamics of the deployment of UAVs to multiple areas, and we present results with simulations of a UAV swarm engaged in a weed monitoring and mapping task."

However, interference and noise can cause delays and packet losses that can degrade control system performance, which leads us to find the optimal network configuration to minimize that impact. Another problem of wireless networks for control systems is caused by time-varying fault patterns, which motivates us to do network reconfiguration at runtime. We focus on the online wireless network reconfiguration in an embedded networked and cyber-physical system (CPS), with four main contributions: (1) the design and implementation of a novel network reconfiguration framework with offline and online components that consider time-correlated link failures; (2) a network imperfection model; (3) six online reconfiguration algorithms for wireless control system; (4) a case study with 12 hops and up to 50 nodes that controls a nonlinear small modular nuclear reactor.

As a result, many of these children struggle at school. Our work explores the effectiveness of using a mindfulness-oriented, neurofeedback-based, brain-computer system to help teach children living in poverty to self-regulate anxiety and attention. Our system, called Mind-Full, was specifically designed for illiterate girls who attend an NGO-funded school in Pokhara, Nepal. In this paper, we present the results of a waitlist control field experiment with 21 girls who completed an intervention using the Mind-Full system. Our results indicated that a 6-week Mind-Full intervention was viable and that children were able to transfer self-regulation skills learned using our system into real-world settings and continue to self-regulate successfully after 2 months. We present our findings as a validation of the effectiveness of mobile neurofeedback-based interventions to help young children living in poverty develop self-regulation skills. We conclude with a discussion of the results, methodological challenges of working in the developing world, and advice for future investigations of the effectiveness of neurofeedback applications for children."

To date, few methodologies are available which can be exploited by domain experts with limited programming expertise to model and subsequently analyze complex systems typical of their application domains. In this paper the easyABMS methodology is proposed to overcome the lack of integrated methodologies able to seamlessly guide domain experts from the analysis of the system under consideration to its modeling and analysis of simulation results. The effectiveness of easyABMS is also experimented through a case study in the logistics domain which concerns the analysis of different policies for managing vehicles used for stacking and moving containers in a transhipment terminal. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper gives an overview of the application of the EID to the control of vehicle locomotion, either from within the vehicle, as a driver or a pilot, or from the outside, as an operator or a (air traffic) controller. It discusses lessons learned from the application of the EID for the vehicle locomotion control task and focuses on how the methodology can be applied to this domain. Specific issues identified are that the planning and control of a vehicle simultaneously spans multiple time scales and that the interface must be designed considering the format in which the control input is defined. Also, due to the extensive standardization of the instrumentation and training certification, changes introduced by the new displays must initially be additional to the existing displays. Chosen representations must also be shown in a format that matches the current instrumentation and the directly observable outside world."

We used a Wizard-of-Oz elicitation study to investigate the viability of eyes-free word processing in the mobile context and to elicit user requirements for such scenarios. Results showed that meta-level operations like highlight and comment, and core operations like insert, delete and replace are desired by users. However, users were challenged by the lack of visual feedback and the cognitive load of remembering text while editing it. We then studied a commercial-grade dictation application and discovered serious limitations that preclude comfortable speak-to-edit interactions. We address these limitations through EDITalk's closed-loop interaction design, enabling eyes-free operation of both meta-level and core word processing operations in the mobile context. Finally, we discuss implications for the design of future mobile, voice-based, eyes-free word processing interface."

Velocity distribution of reflected molecules are compared using Molecular Dynamics (MD), diffuse reflection model, Maxwell model and CLL model. All three models differ from MD results in tangential velocity distribution while Maxwell model has better agreement with MD results in normal velocity distribution. Thus, Maxwell model is used as boundary condition for the flow past a cylinder. Using different accommodation coefficient: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, five flow fields and surface properties are obtained. It is found that as TMAC increases, boundary layer gradually develops, the length of wake flow increases and the distance between the shock and cylinder decreases. Shear stress increases and slip velocity decreases greatly with larger TMAC, but as TMAC increases, the influence of TMAC change on flow field and surface properties change decreases."

In this study, we determined the changes in total phenol content, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol in the leaves of four olive cultivars ('Gaidourelia', 'Kalamon', 'Koroneiki' and 'Megaritiki') grown under water deficit conditions for two months. Furthermore, we investigated the photosynthetic performance in terms of gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence, as well as malondialdehyde content and antioxidant activity. One-year-old self-rooted plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments that received a water amount equivalent to 100% (Control, C), 66% (Field Capacity 66%, FC66) and 33% (Field Capacity 33%, FC33) of field capacity. Measurements were conducted 30 and 60 days after the initiation of the experiment. Net CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and Fv/Fm ratio decreased only in FC33 plants. Photosynthetic rate was reduced mainly due to stomatal closure, but damage to PSII also contributed to this decrease. Water stress induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds, especially oleuropein, suggesting their role as antioxidants. Total phenol content increased in FC33 treatment and oleuropein presented a slight increase in FC66 and a sharper one in FC33 treatment. Hydroxytyrosol showed a gradual decrease as water stress progressed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased due to water stress, mostly after 60 days, while antioxidant activity increased for all cultivars in the FC33 treatment. 'Gaidourelia' could be considered as the most tolerant among the tested cultivars, showing higher phenolic concentration and antioxidant activity and lower lipid peroxidation and photochemical damage after two months of water stress. The results indicated that water stress affected olive tree physiological and biochemical parameters and magnitude of this effect depended on genotype, the degree of water limitation and duration of treatment. However, the severity as well as the duration of water stress might exceed antioxidant capacity, since MDA levels and subsequent oxidative damage increased after two months of water deficit. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS."

In response to this challenge, various types of delay compensation algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have enhanced the teleoperation performance in terms of route following accuracy and task completion time. However, little is known about how delay compensation algorithms affect human operators workload. This study, therefore, aimed to assess how one delay compensation algorithm, the model-free predictor, affects operators workload and teleoperation performance. A dual-task driving simulator was utilized in the present study, where participants drove a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) while performing a 1-back memory task. Preliminary results revealed that the delay compensation aid can reduce operators workload while enhancing primary task performance."

However, there is a need to understand not only whether eHealth interventions work, but also what kind of functions and mechanisms enhance their effectiveness. The present investigation contributes to tackling these challenges by investigating the role played by functional interactivity on patients' knowledge, empowerment, and health outcomes. Objectives: To test whether health knowledge and empowerment mediate a possible relationship between the availability of interactive features on an eHealth application and individuals' health outcomes. We present an empirical, model-driven evaluation of the effects of functional interactivity implemented in an eHealth application, based on a brief theoretical review of the constructs of interactivity, health knowledge, empowerment, and health outcomes. We merged these constructs into a theoretical model of interactivity effects that we tested on an eHealth application for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods: This study used a pretest-posttest experimental design. We recruited 165 patients and randomly assigned them to three study groups, corresponding to different levels of functional interactivity. Eligibility to participate in the study required that patients (1) be fluent in Italian, (2) have access to the Internet, (3) report confidence in how to use a computer, and (4) have received a diagnosis of FMS from a doctor. We used structural equation modeling techniques to analyze changes between the pretest and the posttest results. Results: The main finding was that functional interactivity had no impact on empowerment dimensions, nor direct observable effects on knowledge. However, knowledge positively affected health outcomes (b = -.12, P = .02), as did the empowerment dimensions of meaning (b = -.49, P < .001) and impact (b = -.25, P < .001). Conclusion: The theoretical model was partially confirmed, but only as far as the effects of knowledge and empowerment were concerned. The differential effect of interactive functions was by far weaker than expected. The strong impact of knowledge and empowerment on health outcomes suggests that these constructs should be targeted and enhanced by eHealth applications."

Previous work has focused on communicating directionality of flight, intentionality of the robot, and perception of motion in sUAVs, while interactions involving direct distancing from these vehicles have been limited to a single study (likely due to safety concerns). This study takes place in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) to maintain a sense of scale and immersion with the users, while also allowing for safe interaction. Additionally, the two-alternative forced-choice method is employed as a unique methodology to the study of collocated HRI in order to both study the impact of these variables on preference and allow participants to choose whether or not to interact with a specific robot. This article will be of interest to end-users of sUAV technologies to encourage appropriate distancing based on their application, practitioners in HRI to understand the use of this new methodology, and human-aerial vehicle researchers to understand the perception of these vehicles by 64 naive users. Results suggest that low speed (by 0.27m, p < 0.02) and high cyclicity (by 0.28m, p < 0.01) expressions can be used to increase distancing; that low speed (by 4.4s, p < 0.01) and three-dimensional (by 2.6s, p < 0.01) expressions can be used to decrease time of interaction; and low speed (by 10.4%, p < 0.01) expressions are less preferred for passability in human-aerial vehicle interactions."

Physico-chemical properties of the formulations were examined and discussed. Penetration data was gathered using two different in vitro test systems: the Saarbruecken penetration model (SB-M) and the Franz diffusion cell (FD-C). With wool alcohol ointments, drug concentration in the formulation was the decisive parameter for drug liberation and penetration. The incorporation of water into wool alcohol ointment led to increased drug amounts within the deeper skin layers (DSL), especially after longer incubation times. The drug concentration within the stratum corneum (SC) was not influenced by the bleeding effect of lipophilic, liquid components of the various wool alcohol ointments. With polyacrylate gels different results for liberation and penetration were observed. These results could be related to the effects of the drug concentration within the formulation and the penetration enhancers incorporated into the gels. Especially the effects of penetration enhancers clearly illustrated that liberation experiments do not predict the situation in the skin, but make experiments with a biological barrier essential. The high water content of the gels led to hydration of the skin specimen for the SB-M and the FD-C and therefore, in contrast to previous findings, comparable data were obtained in the penetration studies with both models. Furthermore, the quasi steady-state drug amount in the SC could be calculated for all formulations using an equation derived from a Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The data from both test systems were linearly correlated to each other. In addition, a direct linear relationship between the SC drug amount and the drug amount in the DSL was found as long as the quasi steady-state drug amount in the SC was not reached. A combination of all results might offer the chance to reduce the costs and to simplify the development of a new drug formulation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Dose-dependent decreases of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and increases of malondialdehyde (MDA) were induced in the medaka embryo, suggesting that oxidative damage was induced by nano-iron. For adult medaka, the disturbance of antioxidative balance was observed during the early exposure period based on the monitoring of the hepatic and cerebral SOD and reduced glutathione (GSH). No terminal oxidative damage occurred during the whole exposure period, probably due to the high self-recovering capability of the adult fish. Some histopathological and morphological alterations (cell swelling, hyperplasia, and granulomas, etc.) were observed in gill and intestine tissues, which confirmed that deleterious effects occurred as a result of direct contact with nano-iron. It is suggested that further evaluation should be made concerning the risk assessment of waterborne nano-iron on aquatic life. © 2008."

Within the scope of the given subject, an optimal offline optimization, based on Dynamic Programming (DP), is proposed in this work, permitting to have simultaneous speed profile optimization and optimal power split strategy of a series-parallel hybrid bus. Afterwards, the basis of the offline optimal strategy has been adapted in order to deal online with the current road profile and driver velocity demand. The proposed online and sub-optimal strategy uses mainly a Multi-Dimensional Database (MDD, which gives as output the speed profile and power-split set-points) and an appropriate interpolation technique in order to cope with the current bus situations. The MDD is obtained based on offline DP, while using specific protocol which cover a large possible space state of the vehicle situations and their corresponding optimal set-points. The developed strategy finds its practical application in ACCwSG for a heavy urban bus, which is subject to frequent highly energy consuming starts and stops phases. The present work is conducted on a dedicated high-fidelity dynamical model of the hybrid bus that was developed on MATLAB/TruckMaker software. Several simulations were performed to prove the efficiency of the proposed navigation strategy."

Custom hardware designs significantly accelerate the execution of these algorithms. In this article, we demonstrate a high-performance B&B implementation on FPGAS. First, we identify general elements of B&B algorithms and describe their implementation as a finite state machine. Then, we introduce workers that autonomously cooperate using work stealing to allow parallel execution and full utilization of the target FPGA. Finally, we explore advantages of instance-specific designs that target a specific problem instance to improve performance. We evaluate our concepts by applying them to a branch and bound problem, the reconstruction of corrupted AES keys obtained from cold-boot attacks. The evaluation shows that our work stealing approach is scalable with the available resources and provides speedups proportional to the number of workers. Instance-specific designs allow us to achieve an overall speedup of 47× compared to the fastest implementation of AES key reconstruction so far. Finally, we demonstrate how instance-specific designs can be generated just-in-time such that the provided speedups outweigh the additional time required for design synthesis."

Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to use single-shot Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detection algorithms that process the input image to detect various objects of interest. To keep the computational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small image sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is further emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the viewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects of interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image and processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and a memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not processed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show that by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve the detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that resize and process a single image which makes the proposed approach suitable for UAV applications."

Our approach (SLASHDP) learns the low-dimensional cost structure of an optimal control problem via an efficient spectral method. This structure results in a symmetric value function that serves as a an efficiently-computable surrogate for the true value function. High-quality feedback motion plans can then be obtained from the symmetric value function. Experimental results show that SLASHDP yields higher-quality plans than can be obtained by post-processing plans generated by a sampling-based motion planner, and with less computational effort for very high-dimensional problems. We demonstrate high-quality dynamic programming plans for an arm planning problem of up to 144 dimensions without using any domain-specific knowledge aside from that learned automatically by SLASHDP. Positive results are also shown for a high-dimensional deformable robot planning problem. © 2011 IEEE."

This expansion is usually performed by the development of software involving all heterogeneous and autonomous partners. The user requirement collection and analysis is one of the most important phase of the life cycle of software development. In the context of globalization, this phase becomes a challenging issue. This is because designers of each branch of a given global company may use different vocabulary and formalism to express their requirements. Solutions exist in the literature to unify either vocabularies or formalisms, but not both. In this paper, we propose a semantic and scalable approach that unifies the vocabularies and formalisms by the means of ontologies. The capabilities of reasoning offered by ontologies is exploited to identify the inconsistencies in an efficient way. Our approach is validated by a case tool using three formalisms: the UML use case, the goal oriented and the treatment conceptual model of Merise method. © 2013 ACM."

The method has been developed to analyze X-ray images of a stomach. Owing to the physical (not physiological) deformation of the stomach and changes of the camera angle the shape of the stomach regions are fairly different among the images. In order to collectively analyze these images we use an elastic stomach model. Firstly our method builds an elastic stomach model based on the stomach shape in one image. Considering each photographing condition the deformation of the stomach in each image is simulated with the elastic model. Referring to the predicted contour which is obtained by projecting the deformed model from the camera angle of each image the contour is robustly extracted from noisy images in a model-driven way. Since the predicted contour registered in each image corresponds with the elastic model the position of each stomach part in the image is simultaneously obtained; corresponding parts can be found among the images through the model. Experimental results of analyzing several types of stomach X-ray images are shown and discussed. © 1996 IEEE.

To avoid these problems, we present a method to formally accumulate and derive configuration data, based on the electric/electronic architecture model, that is developed in the vehicle design phase. Our approach also includes the calculation of FlexRay parameters, frame packing and message scheduling. The data exchange between the EEA model and the configuration tool is based on a customized XML structure covering all information for a complete FlexRay configuration.

Energy planners have used several techniques for electricity consumption forecasting in order to predict more accurate future demand. There are two different grey prediction techniques that use in this paper to forecasting the electricity consumption in Thailand. The proposed tune-GM (1,1) is modified from the original GM(1,1) by adjusting a weight or alpha during generating of background sequence. Effect of alpha variation to the grey prediction accuracy were investigated. Actual data of electricity consumption in Thailand between 2004 and 2013 were used to modeling and between 2014 and 2016 were used to testing or validation approach. Mean average percentage error (MAPE) is selected to measure in accuracy view. The computational results show that the proposed tune-GM(1,1) can outperform the original grey prediction model (GM(1,1))."

Typically, information is captured on paper source documents for later transcription to an electronic format, where responses can be checked, and errors, omissions, and inconsistencies can be resolved. These steps contribute delays, cost, and complexity to clinical research, particularly in large-scale multi-site investigations. To address these issues, we used a mobile computing device with a touch-screen display (""tablet PC"") to capture clinical data from depressed patients directly into electronic format. We then examined ease of use, the equivalence of responses between paper and electronic methods, and the acceptability of the tablet PC for this clinical population. Settings: Outpatient clinics at four medical centers. Methods: 80 adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) completed the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated (QIDS-SR16), using both traditional paper forms and an electronic representation of the same questions; participants also completed a survey to evaluate their experience. Results: QIDS-SR16 responses from paper and electronic versions were highly correlated (mean total: 15.3 (SD = 5.2) electronic vs. 15.1 (SD = 5.2) paper format), and showed high inter-rating reliability for overall score (intra-class correlation 0.987 (with a 95%CI [0.979, 0.992])) and high degree of association for individual symptom items. Participants found both methods acceptable and overall found the electronic implementation easier to use. Conclusions: QIDS-SR16 values collected electronically from research participants were equivalent to those collected using traditional paper self-assessment forms. Participants with MDD found the tablet PC version to be acceptable and easier to use than the paper forms. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

These models have been developed for digital games; however, they have been frequently applied in gameful design (i.e., designing non-game applications with game elements) without empirical validation of their fit to this different context. It is not clear if users experience game elements embedded in applications similarly to how players experience them in games. Consequently, we still lack a conceptual framework of design elements built specifically for a gamification context. To fill this gap, we propose a classification of eight groups of gameful design elements produced from an exploratory factor analysis based on participants' self-reported preferences. We describe the characteristics of the users who are more likely to enjoy each group of design elements in terms of their gender, age, gamification user type, and personality traits. Our main contribution is providing an overview of which design elements work best for what demographic clusters and how we can apply this knowledge to design effective gameful systems."

This method relies on the use of a Data-Flow model to describe an application structure and behavior. This model is then transformed through an iterative process to refine an execution model using hardware/software resources described by the user. This approach is composed of a set of tasks and their matching validation to ensure tracking of the implementation validity and performance along the design flow. This method is then used for the implementation of a full vision-based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping systems on an heterogeneous architecture. The SLAM algorithm aims at computing the position of a mobile and build a map of its surrounding using a set of sensors. In vision-based SLAM this position is estimated by tracking features along time in images acquired by a set of cameras. The algorithm relies on several compute-intensive tasks for both vision and estimation making this problem hard to solve on resources limited platform such as embedded systems.

The research reported in this paper follows a qualitative approach applied to three municipalities, focusing on current events in order to answer two question: Which emerging technologies are used by municipal governments in the State of Mexico? and How do these emerging technologies interact with organizational forms and outputs in municipal governments of the State of Mexico? Based on the Fountain's Technology Enactment Theory, semi-structured interviews were conducted to ten participants. Findings show that emerging technologies in developing countries improve organizational efficiency, create new communication channels, break bureaucratic barriers, and help the decision-making process. Technology, boosted by laws, increases transparency, improves Government to Citizen interaction (G2C). Mobile technology is an important tool to generate emergent communication channels within organizations and to improve G2C. The dynamic interaction between emerging technologies, organizational forms and outcomes in municipalities in the State of Mexico, is driven by legislation. Technology Enactment Theory represents a suitable framework to study the interaction between technologies and organizations, especially in governments. However, with the evolution of governments, they are developing different kinds of technologies oriented to service delivery. So, it is important to add the citizenship component, in order to answer questions such as those generated in the current research. It is important to identify the answers to this kind of questions and it is also important to identify good practices, policies, and technology's implementation, that could be applied in similar governments, in order to have success in E-Government's projects."

It does not indicate what is sufficient and leaves room for interpretation. Yet the architects of electric/electronic systems need design boundaries to make decisions during architecture evolutionary design without adding a risk of late changes. Correct selection of safety mechanisms from alternatives at early design stages is vital for time-to-market of critical systems. In this paper we present and discuss an iterative architecture design and refinement process that is centered around ISO 26262 requirements and model-based analysis of safety-related metrics. This process simplifies identification of the most sensitive parts of the architecture, selection of the best suitable safety mechanisms to reduce thereby failure rate on the system level and improve the metrics defined by the standard. To support the defined process we present the metamodels that can be integrated with existing DSL (domain-specific language) frameworks to extend them with information supporting further extraction of fault propagation behavior. We provide a framework for architecture model analysis and selection of safety mechanisms.

Given the complexity of the involved network protocols and the context in which networks are operating, such optimizations are increasingly difficult to perform. An interesting vision in this regard are ""self-driving"" networks: networks which measure, analyze and control themselves in an automated manner, reacting to changes in the environment (e.g., demand), while exploiting existing flexibilities to optimize themselves. A fundamental challenge faced by any (self-)optimizing network concerns the limited knowledge about future changes in the demand and environment in which the network is operating. Indeed, given that reconfigurations entail resource costs and may take time, an ""optimal"" network configuration for the current demand and environment may not necessarily be optimal also in the near future. Thus, it is desirable that (self-)optimizations also prepare the network for possibly unexpected events. This paper makes the case for empowering self-driving networks: empowerment is an information-centric measure which accounts for how ""prepared"" a network is and how much flexibility is preserved over time. While empowerment has been successfully employed in other domains such as robotics, we are not aware of any applications in networking. As a case study for the use of empowerment in networks, we consider self-driving networks offering topological flexibilities, i.e., reconfigurable edges."

We present results on the trade-offs between the end-to-end communication delay and the energy spent in millimeter wave vehicular communications in urban settings. This study exploits the self-similarities of the traffic and vehicle locations in cities captured in our innovative model called “hyperfractal”. We enrich the model by incorporating road-side infrastructure. We use analytical tools to derive theoretical bounds for the end-to-end communication hop count under two different energy constraints: either total accumulated energy, or maximum energy per node. More precisely, we prove that the hop count is bounded by O(n 1 −α/( dm −1 ) ) where α < 1 and d m > 2 is the precise hyperfractal dimension. This proves that for both constraints the energy decreases as we allow to chose among paths of larger length. In fact, the asymptotic limit of the energy becomes significantly small when the number of nodes becomes asymptotically large. A lower bound on the network throughput capacity with constraints on path energy is also given. The results are confirmed through simulations using different fractal dimensions and path loss coefficients."

Adaptation is achieved by changing the behavioral mode of a component in response to perceptions. We realize behavioral modes by roles which a component can dynamically adopt. For specification, we propose adaptation automata which allow to specify complex adaptation behaviour by hierarchical structure and history of states.

Models@run.time is a promising modeldriven approach that supports the runtime adaptation of distributed, heterogeneous systems. Yet frameworks that accommodate this paradigm have limited support to address security concerns, hindering their usage in real scenarios. We address this challenge by enhancing models@ run.time with the concepts of trust and reputation. Trust improves decision-making processes under risk and uncertainty and constitutes a distributed and flexible mechanism that does not entail heavyweight administration. This chapter introduces a trust and reputation framework that is integrated into a distributed component model that implements the models@run.time paradigm, thus allowing software components to include trust in their reasoning process. The framework is illustrated in a smart grid scenario."

However, simply organizing software systems in terms of components does not by itself ensure that the components will be reusable, or that significant levels of reuse will actually occur. In practice, to achieve meaningful levels of reuse the scope and generality of components must be carefully analyzed and optimized. In this paper we make the case that one of the most effective and systematic ways of achieving this is to complement component-based development with product line engineering techniques. Product line engineering not only provides concrete criteria for maximizing the reusability of components, but also provides enhanced mechanisms for reusing them within new applications. After first outlining the pertinent features of component-based development and product line engineering, the paper explains how they can be integrated under the umbrella of a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach to software development."

In addition, these service descriptions must carry their associated security policies with them to be able to decide whether resources are usable when upscaling or moving a service. To this end, we illustrate the definition of security policies in the technology-agnostic TOSCA service specification language. Our goal is to initiate the development of a security policy catalog for NFV services and the implementation of the necessary software tools for their enforcement."

It is also often cited that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related robotics is a critical area of future innovation in computing. However, there are a number of challenges to implementing a robotic curriculum at the university level. A few of those challenges include, lack of a uniform hardware platform, incongruity in the software used, and the missing significant deliverable artifacts by students at the end of a term to encourage learning and further interest. Educational robotic activities are often treated as advanced research topics with high associated costs that prohibit widespread integration into the curriculum. In this paper, we present the deployment of a multi-stage robotic platform that attempts to address these challenges and overcome the obstacles. We detail the evolution of the hardware from using a readily available LEGO Mindstorm base platform to next include the addition of an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Likewise, we detail the transition from the basic LEGO Mindstorm software to the use of leJOS and PYTHON. At each stage, additional sensors and software libraries can likewise be added. Finally, we present an achievable academic goal for students to use the hardware and software platforms to develop a model autonomous vehicle with aspects of intelligent control, learning and adaptive behaviour. All levels of projects can be undertaken at the appropriate level of maturity for the students in the computing curriculum."

In that context, UML diagrams play a central role in the whole software engineering process, starting from early analysis, through implementation, to maintenance. Recent surveys of UML use in industry showed that software practitioners use it on a regular basis, and particularly for communication and as a mental-assist tool. However, they also pointed out the following weaknesses: the lack of context, graphical layout problems, and the language's inadequacy as a facility for communication between technical teams and their clients. In this paper, we present a general approach that addresses these problems by enhancing the effectiveness of UML models as a communication vehicle. Our approach is based on expressing stakeholder-specific viewpoints through the use of secondary notations. This involves the use of auxiliary visual variables (e.g., color, position, size) that are not formally specified in UML. To that end, we extend the traditional concept of layer found in many graphical editors to UML diagram editors. FlipLayers is an implementation of our approach. It is in the form of a plugin for the Papyrus modeling environment. One scenario with several case studies is presented in the paper to demonstrate the benefits of our approach and also to illustrate how to express viewpoints with FlipLayers."

Nevertheless, component composition is not straightforward and is subject to the occurrence of bugs resulting from components or services incompatibilities for instance. Hence, bugs detection in component-based systems at the design level is very important, particularly, when the developed system concerns automotive applications supporting critical services. In this paper, we propose a formal approach for modeling and verifying the reliability of an autonomous vehicle system, communicating continuously with off-road infrastructure. We focus on components offering critical services with hard time constraint defining the delay of their availability. We propose to verify whether a set of components, when composed according to the system architecture specified with SysML models, achieve their tasks by respecting their interaction protocols and their time constraints."

Some mobile-sensor-based approaches developed in recent years can help identify critical points for understanding the queue process. This involves using sample data related to travel time or trajectory. The latest video imaging detectors facilitate the collection of significant lane-based travel time data, from detectors installed at fixed locations. This paper presents a method to estimate lane-based queue length using the travel time data collected by these new detectors. The first vehicle leaving the downstream stop line is defined as the ""leading vehicle"" in each signal cycle. The key premise underlying this new method is that the maximum queue length in the first cycle, when the ""leading vehicle"" is queued, is related to the leading vehicle's delay time and the duration of the red light in each cycle. Queue length in the current cycle is derived by analyzing the recursive formula of maximum queue lengths across different cycles. Finally, the new model's precision is evaluated using a field survey. The results show that the new method has a higher precision compared to the existing method based in a similar concept, with maximum and average deviations of 39.36% and 12.25% respectively, over twenty cycles. The findings of this paper can be applied to improve on traffic signal control systems."

In this paper, McKibben pneumatic actuators acting as artificial muscles are adopted to drive the robot joint. We propose a sensing mechanism that estimates the contact information instead of attaching sensors on the contact point and joint. We focus on the passivity of the pneumatic actuator, which is deformed according to the external force. The pressure is passively changed following Boyle-Charles' law. This paper deals with one degree of freedom test bed model driven by two antagonistic pneumatic actuators. Using the pressures before and after the force is applied, the model derives the contact information. The experimental results show that the force and the angle can be estimated. We also measure the range of force that the system can sustain. These results indicate that the sensorless estimation of contact information can be realized by employing the passivity of the pneumatic actuator. © 2011 IEEE."

This paper considers the fundamental problem of how to evacuate two robots from a unit disk. The robots, initially located at the center of the disk, need to exit the disk through two unknown exits, at known distance d from each other, located at the perimeter of the disk. The robots can coordinate when exploring the disk, using wireless communication. The objective is to minimize the evacuation time, i.e., the time until the last robot exits the disk. We consider two different model variants, where exits can either be labeled or unlabeled. We complement our analysis with simulations."

Developers require detailed knowledge with respect to the different underlying data schemata, semantic mappings, and, most importantly, the query language used by the storage system (e.g. SPARQL, SQL, or general-purpose language interfaces/APIs). While for instance database developers are familiar with technical aspects of query languages, application developers of interactive scenarios typically lack the specific knowledge to efficiently work with complex database management systems. Addressing this gap, in this paper we describe a model-driven software development based approach to create a long-term storage system to be employed in the domain of embodied interaction in smart environments (EISE). To support this, we created multiple domain specific languages using Jetbrains MPS to model the high level EISE domain, to represent the employed graph query language Cypher and to perform necessary model-to-model transformations. As main result, we present the EISE Query-Designer, a fully integrated workbench to facilitate data storage and retrieval by supporting and guiding developers in the query design process and allowing direct query execution without the need to have prior in-depth knowledge of the domain at hand. In this paper we report in detail on the study design, execution, first knowledge gained from our experiments, and lastly the lessons learned from the development process up to this point."

As a result, many performance tests, competitions, demonstrations, and analyses have been devised to measure the autonomy, intelligence, and overall effectiveness of robots. These range from robot soccer (football) to measuring the performance of a robot in computer simulations. However, many resultant designs are narrowly focused oroptimized against the specific tasks under consideration. In the Multi-Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge (MAGIC) 2010, the need to transition the technology beyond the laboratory and into contexts for which it had not specifically been designed or tested meant that a performance evaluation scheme was needed that avoided domain-specific tests. However, the scheme still had to retain the capacity to deliver an impartial, consistent, objective, and evidence-based assessment that rewarded individual and multivehicle autonomy. It was also important to maximize the understanding and outcomes for technologists, sponsors, and potential usersgained through after-action review. The need for real-time, simultaneous, and continuous tracking of multiple interacting entities in an urban environment and over 250,000 square meters in real time compounded the complexity of the task.

One of the main requirements for this certification is having a set of explicit test cases for each software requirement. To achieve this, the DO-178C standard recommends using a model-driven approach. For instance, model-based testing (MBT) is recommended in its DO-331 supplement to automatically generate system-level test cases for the requirements provided as the specification models. In addition, the DO-178C standard also requires high level of source code coverage, which typically is achieved by a separate set of structural testing. However, the standard allows targeting high code coverage with MBT, only if the applicants justify their plan on how to achieve high code coverage through model-level testing. In this study, we propose using the Modified Condition and Decision coverage (""MC/DC"") criterion on the specification-level constraints rather than the standard-recommended ""all transition coverage"" criterion, to achieve higher code coverage through MBT. We evaluate our approach in the context of a case study at MicroPilot Inc., our industry collaborator, which is a UAV producer company. We implemented our idea as an MC/DC coverage on transition guards in a UML state-machine-based testing tool that was developed in-house. The results show that applying model-level MC/DC coverage outperforms the typical transition-coverage (DO-178C's required MBT coverage criterion), with respect to source code-level ""all condition-decision coverage criterion"" by 33%. In addition, our MC/DC test suite detected three new faults and two instances of legacy specification in the code that are no longer in use, compared to the ""all transition"" test suite."

From such models, existing tools might be employed to generate test cases automatically. While MBT represents a promising step towards the automation of test case generation, the quality of the model designed by the tester may impact, either positively or negatively, on its ability to reveal faults (i.e., the test effectiveness). Objective: In this context, we conducted a preliminary experiment to evaluate the impact caused by different testers when designing a test model for the same functionality. Method: In the experiment, the participants used Event Sequence Graphs and its supporting tool FourMA to create test models for two mobile apps: arXiv-mobile and WhoHasMyStuff. From the test models, test cases were generated using FourMA and concretized by means of the Robotium framework. In order to measure the impact of different testers, we employed code coverage (namely, instruction and branch coverage) as an estimation of test effectiveness. Results: Based on the results obtained, we observe high variation of code coverage among the testers. No tester was capable of producing a test model that subsumes all other testers' models with respect to code coverage. Moreover, factor learning seems not to reduce the code coverage variation. The relation between model size, modeling time, and code coverage were inconclusive. Conclusion: We conclude that further research effort on the MBT's modeling step is required to not only reduce the variation between testers, but also improving its effectiveness."

To the student, this kind of technology often has abstract behaviours where the only information/things people can see is the final action, and they do not know how the internal processes work and communicate inside the embedded computing device to achieve the desired result. Augmented reality (AR) can overcome this issue and produce a magic-lens view for revealing hidden embedded computing activities. This can result in learners achieving a better level of knowledge and awareness of the technology, as well as higher learning outcomes. AR on its own will not improve the learning processes without first considering how to manage and represent the hidden information. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed, and to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model. We conducted an experiment based on a problem-solving educational mobile robot task. Twenty students participated in the experimental (AR approach) and control (conventional approach) group. The result showed that the augmented reality approach was more effective in increasing students' computational thinking and learning outcomes. In addition, the augmented reality approach reduced both time completion and debugging times."

In addition, DNA damage was evaluated in soft tissues and organs like spleen, liver and kidney cells. The oxidative damage was assessed by selective biochemical parameters by the measurement of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) activity in liver. Adult Swiss albino male mice were exposed to sodium fluoride in drinking water at the concentrations of 4, 12 and 20. mg/L for 30 consecutive days. Control groups (vehicle and positive) were also included. Animals were sacrificed; bone marrow and soft tissue samples were collected and subjected to series of assays respectively. We observed that NaF exposure, at the various concentrations tested caused a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), structural chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells. With the exception of the spleen cells, DNA damage was observed in bone marrow cells as well as in kidney and liver cells. We found an increase in lipid peroxidation, and catalase activity as well as decrease in glutathione activity (GSH and GST) in liver of mice respectively which were exposed to sodium fluoride.

In this paper, we evaluate the relationships between virtual robot and real one based on human impressions through several experiments. © 2009 IEEE."

ISs should be particularly adaptive and context-aware by managing and responding properly to occurring events. A need of integrating an adaptive and distributed event based system raises to lead to a diversity of proposed approaches and architectures. Unfortunately, the high level link between context and events is not explicitly considered in these systems. In this paper, we propose a metamodel coupling context and event metadata. The metamodel highlights some requirements considered in the definition of an event processing architecture to maximize communication security between distributed components. Context-aware event processing is a natural result of such architecture enabling the integration of context reasoning in event based systems. The proposal is used to implement an assistant prototype for passengers in the public transportation domain. © 2010 IEEE."

We identify properties that causal relations assume and that determine how, as well as to what extent, we may ascribe ethical responsibility on their basis. The paper is structured in three parts. First, we present an extension of the Event Calculus that enables the agent to generate plans of actions, with the particularity that they integrate both actions and omissions. Second, we present an account of event-based causality that is grounded in the architecture of event preconditions and effects, and that distinguishes four types of causal relations contingent on the nature of the entities that compose them. Namely, it discriminates actions and omissions from automatic events, and produced outcomes from avoided ones. Third, we examine notions of scenario-based causality whose rote it is to scrutinise and buttress the causal relations previously identified. Inquiring into the other possible versions of modelled scenarios, we account for simple counter-factual validity ('Had I not acted so, would this outcome still be true?'), criticality ('Could anything else have led to this outcome?'), extrinsic necessity (Had I not produced it, was this outcome even avoidable?'), and elicited necessity ('Have I made this outcome unavoidable?'). The model is implemented in Answer Set Programming."

We have developed such a planning system that uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign waypoints and mission goals to multiple UGVs so that they jointly achieve a set of mission goals. Our evolutionary system applies domain-specific genetic operators, termed tactical advocates because they capture specific tactical behaviors, to make targeted improvements to plans. The plans are evaluated using a set of tactical critics that together comprise a multiobjective fitness function. Each critic evaluates a plan against criteria such as avoiding an enemy or meeting mission goals. Experimental results show that this approach produces high-quality plans with the potential for real-time dynamic replanning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004."

Individuals achieve a common task through association with others or division of labor. Evolutionary game dynamics offers a basic framework to investigate how agents self-adaptively switch their strategies in accordance with various targets, and also the evolution of their behaviors. In this paper, we analytically study the strategy evolution in a multiple player game model driven by self-learning. Self-learning dynamics is of importance for agent strategy updating yet seldom analytically addressed before. It is based on self-evaluation, which applies to distributed control. We focus on the abundance of different strategies (behaviors of agents) and their oscillation (frequency of behavior switching). We arrive at the condition under which a strategy is more abundant over the other under weak selection limit. Such condition holds for any finite population size of N ≥ 3, thus it fits for the systems with finite agents, which has notable advantage over that of pairwise comparison process. At certain states of evolutionary stable state, there exists 'ping-pong effect' with stable frequency, which is not affected by aspirations. Our results indicate that self-learning dynamics of multi-player games has special characters. Compared with pairwise comparison dynamics and Moran process, it shows different effect on strategy evolution, such as promoting cooperation in collective risk games with large threshold. © 2013 IEEE."

The evolution or learning of multi-agent behaviors is known to be challenging [7]. Hence, new approaches still need to be explored. Examples are innovative methods to explore environment-driven, distributed evolution [2, 4]. Here, we are inspired to evolve collective behaviors following a mathematical framework by Friston et al. [3], which defines an information-theoretic analogon to thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy. This free energy is basically an error in the predictions that our brain makes about our environment. Evolution is related by the rationale that minimal prediction errors are achieved by limiting an agent's reactions to sensory input. This results, in turn, in better adapted behaviors: ""By sampling [...] the environment selectively they restrict their exchange with it within bounds that preserve their physical integrity and allow them to last longer"" [3]. The previously investigated evolution of swarm behaviors by minimizing surprisal [5, 6, 9] is subject to this study. Previous studies were limited to artificial 1-d environments, here, we report first results for 2-d. Although adding one dimension may seem a minor step, there are qualitative changes in the emergent behaviors (e.g., flocking is a collective decision with infinitely many options) and the future transition to real robots will be easier starting from 2-d."

Methods: Using a grounded-theory approach, we seek to identify recurring themes of peer-based interaction, without the ongoing management of clinical experts, as a way to determine stakeholder concerns and interests in a domain of frequent clinical uncertainty and treatment, Asperger's syndrome. Results: We find that users of web-based information in such areas often report reliance on information for medical decision making and disease management, at times to the point where interaction becomes a form of 'cybertherapy.' Further, such groups often evolve into disease-specific, 'virtual support groups', even where discussions highlight a lack of consensus regarding the role, function and quality of information within this unique domain. Conclusion: A grounded theory approach can successfully be applied in a domain-specific setting to identify themes in unstructured peer-to-peer discussion of ill-defined diseases and treatments. © 2007 The authorJournal compilation © Health Libraries Group 2007."

Current research in DSLs for robotics applications focuses on abstraction in the solution domain, whereas our DSLs support the domain expert in declaratively describing properties of the domain and loosely coupled tasks. To enable flexible task execution based on the domain expert’s declarative models, these are translated into components of a reference architecture prior to deployment and into planning domain definition language (PDDL) problems at system runtime. Resulting problems are translated into executable plans using the Metric-FF solver and re-translated into iserveU models that ultimately are executed against a loosely coupled robotics middleware. Leveraging model transformation at run-time enables the flexibility necessary for robotics applications deployed to dynamic environments where design-time assumptions and run-time reality diverge easily."

Notch signaling drives developmental processes in all metazoans. The receptor binding region of the human Notch ligand Jagged-1 is made of a DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain and two atypical epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats encoded by two exons, exon 5 and 6, which are out of phase with respect to the EGF domain boundaries. Results. We determined the 1H-NMR solution structure of the polypeptide encoded by exon 6 of JAG1 and spanning the C-terminal region of EGF1 and the entire EGF2. We show that this single, evolutionary conserved exon defines an autonomous structural unit that, despite the minimal structural context, closely matches the structure of the same region in the entire receptor binding module. Conclusion. In eukaryotic genomes, exon and domain boundaries usually coincide. We report a case study where this assertion does not hold, and show that the autonomously folding, structural unit is delimited by exon boundaries, rather than by predicted domain boundaries. © 2009 Pintar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

In the operation and maintenance (O&M) phases, however, the information integration and exchange issue becomes more complicated because software applications here require not only BIM but other information outside of the AEC domain, e.g., disaster mitigation. Nowadays, most BIM-related research focuses on the D&C phases and pays less concern on the O&M phases, hence there is a research need that can help seamlessly transfer the information between the D&C and O&M phases. In this research, a software framework using ontology was designed to deal with aforementioned problems. The BIM data from the D&C phases were used as a foundation to generate new models for different software applications for the O&M phases. The ontology technique was employed to assist the model transformation process between the original BIM and the models for applications. Finally, a disaster mitigation example was chosen to validate the framework, in order to make sure that the transformation process is comprehensive and useful from domain experts' perspective."

Adding Magneto-rheological (MR) fluids in such structures may significantly improve their dynamic response. In the present work, the vibration response of laminated composite beams filled with MR fluids (MR laminated beam) under random loading has been investigated using experimental as well as simulation approaches. Finite Element Model (FEM) has been utilized to simulate the vibration response under random loading. An in-house set-up has been designed to test and investigate the behavior of the laminated beam filled with MR fluid. The simulation results have been validated by experimental ones where a reasonable match has been observed. A mechanical shaker is used to apply a white noise load as input excitation to the beam. Two main common mechanical boundary conditions, namely clamped-free and clamped-clamped boundary conditions have been investigated. The effect of high value (up to 2000 Gauss) of the magnetic field has been investigated. It is observed that increasing the magnetic field up to 1200 Gauss in clamped-free and up to 1500 Gauss in clamped-clamped boundary conditions increases the natural frequency of the structure. Beyond this value, the natural frequencies of some modes decrease. It is realized that by increasing the magnetic field, energy dissipation of MR laminated beam reduced."

We create a framework for evaluating the software quality which integrated design model quality and the final system performance, and conduct analysis using the framework. As a result of analysis, it is found that the quantitative measurement of the structural complexity of the design models bears a strong relationship to qualitative evaluation of the design conducted by judges. It is also found that there is no strong correlation between design model quality evaluated by the judges and the final system performance. For embedded software development, it is particularly important to estimate and verify reliability and performance in the early stages, using the model.

In order to adequately measure several non-functional quality characteristics including performance on the model, it is necessary to improve the way of developing robot software (such as applying model driven development) and reexamine the evaluation methods.

However, users' interactions with their internal representations, including their expectations about data, are also critical for a visualization to support learning. We present multiple graphically-based techniques for eliciting and incorporating a user's prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user's ability to recall and understand the data. We find that participants who are prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations."

Some participants found 75% of high-value items, others found none, with an average of 27%. No association was found between self-reported search expertise and task performance, with a tendency for many participants to overestimate their search expertise. Successful searchers may have more accurate mental models of both search systems and the information space. Organizations may not have effective exploratory search task performance feedback loops, a lack of learning. This may be caused by management bias towards technology, not capability, a lack of systems thinking. Furthermore, organizations may not “know” they “don't know” their true level of search expertise, a lack of knowing. A metamodel is presented identifying the causal factors for workplace exploratory search task performance.

The mixed mode-dependent time-delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. We aim to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in the mean square sense. First, by introducing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that accounts for the mode-dependent mixed delays, stochastic analysis is conducted in order to derive a criterion for the exponential stabilizability problem. Then, a variation of such a criterion is developed to facilitate the controller design by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Finally, it is shown that the desired state feedback controller can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution to a set of LMIs.

We start by investigating what types of states motion timing is capable of expressing, focusing on robot manipulation and keeping the path constant while systematically varying the timing. We find that users naturally pick up on certain properties of the robot (like confidence), of the motion (like naturalness), or of the task (like the weight of the object that the robot is carrying). We then conduct a hypothesis-driven experiment to tease out the directions and magnitudes of these effects, and use our findings to develop candidate mathematical models for how users make these inferences from the timing. We find a strong correlation between the models and real user data, suggesting that robots can leverage these models to autonomously optimize the timing of their motion to be expressive."

It requires an efficient and secure routing protocols to find accurate and secure route between nodes to exchange data traffics. There have been several secure routing proposals to ensure data authentication and integrity services of ad hoc routing protocols. However, most of them are vulnerable against wormhole attacks and therefore cannot be used for UAANET directly without amendment. The wormhole attack involves two attackers who perform a colluding attack. In this paper, we present a new UAANET secure routing protocol called SUAP (Secure Uav Ad hoc routing Protocol). It ensures message authentication and provides detection and prevention of wormhole attacks. SUAP is a reactive protocol using public key cryptography, hash chains and geographical leashes. We have carried out a formal verification analysis of SUAP security properties using the AVISPA tool, an automated model checker for the analysis of security features. We have also validated our security proposal through formal model checking using Simulink and Stateflow tools. Additionally, we use a hybrid experimental system (based on virtual machines and a virtual mesh framework) under a realistic UAANET scenario to evaluate SUAP routing performances and validate its security properties."

Models are built using a language whose syntax is defined by a metamodel. Hence, objects in models are typed by a metamodel class, and this typing is static as it is established at creation time and cannot be changed later. This way, objects in MDE are closed and fixed w.r.t. the type they conform to, the slots they have, and the constraints they should obey. This hampers the reuse of model-related artefacts like transformations, as well as the opportunistic or dynamic combination of metamodels. To alleviate this rigidity, we propose making model objects open so that they can acquire or drop so-called facets, each one contributing a type, slots and constraints to the object. Facets are defined by regular metamodels, hence being a lightweight extension of standard metamodelling. Facet metamodels may declare usage interfaces, and it is possible to specify laws that govern how facets are to be assigned to the instances of a metamodel. In this paper, we describe our proposal, report on an implementation, and illustrate scenarios where facets have advantages over other techniques."

State-of-the-art face tracking methods in the VR context are focused on the animation of rigged 3D avatars (Li et al. 2015; Olszewski et al. 2016). Although they achieve good tracking performance, the results look cartoonish and not real. In contrast to these model-based approaches, FaceVR enables VR teleconferencing using an image-based technique that results in nearly photo-realistic outputs. The key component of FaceVR is a robust algorithm to perform realtime facial motion capture of an actor who is wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), as well as a new data-driven approach for eye tracking from monocular videos. Based on reenactment of a prerecorded stereo video of the person without the HMD, FaceVR incorporates photo-realistic re-rendering in real time, thus allowing artificial modifications of face and eye appearances. For instance, we can alter facial expressions or change gaze directions in the prerecorded target video. In a live setup, we apply these newly introduced algorithmic components."

Research has explored how wearable PA trackers can encourage increased activity, and how the adoption of such trackers is driven by people's emotions and social needs. However, more work is needed to understand how PA trackers are perceived and adopted by low-SES families, where PA may be deprioritized due to economic stresses, limited resources, and perceived crime. Accordingly, we conducted a twomonth, in-depth qualitative study, exploring low-SES caregivers' perspectives on PA tracking and promotion. Our findings show how PA tracking was impacted by caregivers' attitudes toward safety, which were influenced by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional processes. We conclude that PA tracking tools for low-SES families should help caregivers and children to experience and celebrate progress."

The Android platform is a good foundation for such systems since it runs on a wide variety of devices and provides some advanced mechanisms for integrating loosely coupled components. These capabilities facilitate efficient component-based development. However, these mechanisms also introduce some difficulties into the development process. On one hand, some functionalities are not encapsulated into a single piece of code but have to be implemented and configured at several distinct source files. On the other hand, it is easy to break the consistency among these artefacts.

Faster Policy Adaptation in Environments with Exogeneity: A State Augmentation Approach,Zhuoshu Li and Zhitang Chen and Pascal Poupart and Sanmay Das and Yanhui Geng,AAMAS '18,2018,ACM,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-85054673879,,"© 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org). All rights reserved.The reinforcement learning literature typically assumes fixed state transition functions for the sake of tractability. However, in many real-world tasks, the state transition function changes over time, and this change may be governed by exogenous variables outside of the control loop. This can make policy learning difficult. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to address the aforementioned challenge by embedding the state transition functions at different timestamps into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space; the exogenous variable, as the cause of the state transition evolution, is estimated by projecting the embeddings into the subspace that preserves maximum variance. By augmenting the observable state vector with the estimated exogenous variable, standard RL algorithms such as Q-learning are able to learn faster and better. Experiments with both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over standard and advanced variants of Q-learning algorithms in dynamic environments."

Therefore, we present fault injection for test-driven development (TDD) of robust firmware. As TDD is based on instant feedback to the designer, fault injection must execute within few minutes. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, we avoid long simulation scenarios and runtimes by injecting faults at the unit level and utilizing host-compiled simulation. Further, three static bit-level analyses of firmware source code and hardware specification reduce the fault set significantly. This accelerates fault injection by several orders of magnitude and enables robustness-aware TDD."

In particular, it has been shown that the robots can complete certain tasks even in the presence of faulty robots. In this paper, we focus on gathering of all non-faulty robots at a single point in presence of faulty robots. We propose a waitfree algorithm(i.e., no robot waits for other robots and algorithm instructs each robot to move in every step, unless it is already at the gathering location), that gathers all non-faulty robots in the semi-synchronous model without any agreement about the coordinate system and with weak multiplicity detection (i.e., a robot can detect if there are more than one robots at a point, but not their exact number) in the presence of at most n-1 faulty robots for n ≥ 3. We show that the required capability for gathering robots is minimal in the abovemodel, since relaxing it further makes gathering impossible to solve. Also, we introduce an intermediate scheduling model in between the asynchronous (i.e., no instantaneousmovement or computation) and the semi-synchronous (i.e., both instantaneousmovement and computation) as ASYNCIC, the asynchronous model with instantaneous computation. Then we propose another algorithm in ASYNCIC model for gathering all non-faulty robots with weak multiplicity detection without any agreement on the coordinate systemin the presence of at most [n/2]-2 faulty robots for n ≥ 7 starting from any configuration with at most one multiplicity excluding C•(0), C•(1/k), C•(1/2) and C•(1/2+1/k)."

Depending upon the capabilities of the robots, the algorithms are designed to tolerate maximum number of faults. This work assumes weak multiplicity detection capability of the robots. The contribution of this work is in two folds. First, a distributed algorithm is presented which can tolerate at most ([n/2]-1) crash faults for n ≥ 7 robots with weak multiplicity detection only. For the second algorithm, it is also assumed that robots know the mobility capacity of all the robots. The algorithm presented here can tolerate at most (n - 6) crash faults for n ≥ 7 robots."

Application areas of side-scan sonar include archaeology, security and defence, seabed classification, and environmental surveying. In recent years the use of autonomous underwater systems has allowed for automatic collection of data. Along with automatic collection of data comes the need to automatically detect what information is important. Automatic target recognition can allow for efficient task planning and autonomous system deployment for security and defence applications. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are proven general purpose methods for pattern classification. They provide maximum margin classification that does not over fit to training data. It is generally accepted that the choice of kernel function allows for domain specific information to be leveraged in the classification system. In this paper it is shown that for target classification in side-scan sonar, extra feature extraction and data engineering can result in better classification performance compared to parameter optimization alone."

However, feature modeling of large-scale systems is challenging as many models are needed for diverse purposes. For instance, feature models can be used to reflect the perspectives of product management, technical solution architecture, or product configuration. Furthermore, models are required at different levels of granularity. Although numerous approaches and tools are available, it remains hard to define the purpose, scope, and granularity of feature models. In this paper we thus present experiences of developing feature models for two large-scale industrial automation software systems.

It becomes even more challenging when some of the ve-hicles are wheeled (e.g., cars) and some are tracked (e.g., tanks), and are closely spaced. In such cases the stronger acoustic signals from the tracked vehicles can mask those from the wheeled vehicles, leading to poor detection of such targets. A novel detection scheme is presented, according to which the direction of arrival (DoA) angle estimates of emitters are obtained by each sensor array using real data. The full position esti-mates of targets, obtained following the association of the DoA angle estimates of the same target from at least three sensor arrays, are used for target tracking. However, because of the particular challenges encoun-tered in multiple ground vehicle scenarios, this associ-ation is not always reliable and thus, target tracking using kinematic (DoA angle) measurements only is dif-ficult and it can lead to lost tracks. In this paper we propose a new feature-aided multidimensional assign-ment algorithm, to augment the existing assignment al-gorithms which use only kinematic measurements, to improve the association performance, especially in the case of wheeled vehicles. We present a novel frequency domain feature extraction technique by implementing a statistical characterization of the features, in order to enhance the accuracy of data association.

In this paper, the assembly task is formulated as a Markov decision process, and a model-driven deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to accomplish the assembly task through the learned policy without analyzing the contact states. In our algorithm, the learning process is driven by a simple traditional force controller. In addition, a feedback exploration strategy is proposed to ensure that our algorithm can efficiently explore the optimal assembly policy and avoid risky actions, which can address the data efficiency and guarantee stability in realistic assembly scenarios. To improve the learning efficiency, we utilize a fuzzy reward system for the complex assembly process. Then, simulations and realistic experiments of a dual peg-in-hole assembly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The advantages of the fuzzy reward system and feedback exploration strategy are validated by comparing the performances of different cases in simulations and experiments."

In this article, we present Feature-guided and knEe-driven Multi-Objective optimization for Self-Adaptive softwAre (FEMOSAA), a novel framework that automatically synergizes the feature model and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to optimize SAS at runtime. FEMOSAA operates in two phases: at design time, FEMOSAA automatically transposes the engineers' design of SAS, expressed as a feature model, to fit the MOEA, creating new chromosome representation and reproduction operators. At runtime, FEMOSAA utilizes the feature model as domain knowledge to guide the search and further extend the MOEA, providing a larger chance for finding better solutions. In addition, we have designed a new method to search for the knee solutions, which can achieve a balanced tradeoff. We comprehensively evaluated FEMOSAA on two running SAS: One is a highly complex SAS with various adaptable real-world software under the realistic workload trace; another is a service-oriented SAS that can be dynamically composed from services. In particular, we compared the effectiveness and overhead of FEMOSAA against four of its variants and three other search-based frameworks for SAS under various scenarios, including three commonly applied MOEAs, two workload patterns, and diverse conflicting quality objectives. The results reveal the effectiveness of FEMOSAA and its superiority over the others with high statistical significance and nontrivial effect sizes."

In the parasailing trajectory, we focused on the stages of vertical acceleration/deceleration and conducted an experiment to identify how much gain can be applied to the visual acceleration, which makes the user feel the natural self-motion when integrated with the physical stimulus. Then, the results were tested using several types of full-course virtual parasailing. The results showed that fairly large differences between visual and physical stimuli would be accepted and different gains could be assigned depending on the user's altitudes."

Most of the studies in the area focus on indoor positioning and rely on two important assumptions: (i) lights are static, and (ii) the receiver has line-of-sight with multiple lights. These requirements limit the application of localization methods in scenarios where nodes have a single light and are mobile, such as motorbikes or swarms of robots. In general, this particular type of scenarios (single lights moving on a plane) leads to underdetermined localization systems where no unique solution can be found. We follow a holistic approach that includes theory, simulations, and experiments to overcome some of the limitations present in such type of scenarios. Our theoretical and simulation results show that if nodes are enhanced with sensors providing relative directions (such as compasses), we can derive dependencies in the system to obtain unique solutions. Our proof-of-concept implementation validates our model by showing that single lights can provide relative localization with high accuracy: an average error below 5 cm."

The novelty is that all the forces are taken into account in the dynamic model, and the controller uses optimal steering angles and drive forces to obtain the minimum path offset. The integrated algorithms are then used in tracking a predefined path. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach."

The ability to predict when power will be depleted beyond a certain point is necessary for recharging or returning to a base station. This paper presents a framework for forecasting state of charge (SOC) of a robot's battery for a given mission. A generalized and customizable mission description is formulated as a sequence of parametrized tasks defined for the robot; the missions are then mapped to expected change in SOC by training neural networks on experimental data. We present results from experiments on the Turtlebot 2 to establish the efficacy of this framework. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated for three distinct mission representations and compared to an existing method in the literature. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of feedforward and recurrent neural network models in the context of this work."

All rights reserved.In this paper, we train a recurrent neural network to learn dynamics of a chaotic road environment and to project the future of the environment on an image. Future projection can be used to anticipate an unseen environment for autonomous driving. Road environment is highly dynamic and complex due to the interaction among traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians. Even in such a complex environment, a human driver can easily anticipate the environment and is efficacious to drive safely on the chaotic roads. Proliferation in deep learning research has shown the efficacy of neural networks in learning this kind of human behavior. In the same direction, we investigate recurrent neural networks to understand the road environment. We propose Foresee, a unidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) network with attention to project future of the environment in the form of images. We have collected several videos on Delhi roads consisting of various traffic participants, background and infrastructure differences (like 3D pedestrian crossing) at various times on various days. We show that our proposed model performs better than state of the art methods (prednet [9], Enc. Dec. LSTM [15])."

The plan execution module is one component of NASA's New Millennium Remote Agent, an artificial intelligence-based space-craft control system architecture which launched in October of 1998 as part of the DEEP SPACE 1 mission. The bottom layer of the plan execution module architecture is a domain specific language, named ESL (Executive Support Language), implemented as an extension to multithreaded COMMON LISP. ESL supports the construction of reactive control mechanisms for autonomous robots and space-craft. For this case study, we translated the ESL services for managing interacting parallel goal-and-event driven processes into the PROMELA input language of SPIN. A total of five previously undiscovered concurrency errors were identified within the implementation of ESL. According to the Remote Agent programming team, the effort has had a major impact, locating errors that would not have been located otherwise and, in one case, identifying a major design flaw. In fact, in a different part of the system, a concurrency bug identical to one discovered by this study escaped testing and caused a deadlock during an in-flight experiment 96 million kilometers from earth. The work additionally motivated the introduction of procedural abstraction in terms of inline procedures into SPIN."

Therefore, a perspective shift on software development and user-machine interaction is required. An amalgamation of model driven development and ontologies has been envisaged as a promising direction in recent literature. In this paper, we investigate this merged approach and conclude that a merger of both approaches, from formal modelling and knowledge representation perspective, on the one hand enables use of ontologies at run-time together with rules, prominently in terms of run-time reasoning, dynamic adaptations, software intelligibility, self-expressiveness, user involvement, and user situation awareness; and on the other hand at development time, prominently in terms of automated and incremental code generation, requirement adaptability, preservation of application knowledge, and validation and verification of structural and behavioural properties of the software. The core contribution of this paper lies in providing an elaborate and exploratory discussion of the problem and solution spaces along with a multidisciplinary meta-review and identification of complementary efforts in literature required to realise a merged approach.

The realization of these systems is only possible with complex and distributed software. This development poses a challenge for verification and validation. Upcoming standards like ISO 26262 provide requirements for verification and validation during development phases. Advanced test methods are requested for safety critical functions. Formal specification of requirements and appropriate testing strategies in different stages of the development cycle are part of it. In this paper we present our approach to formalize the requirements specification by test models. These models serve as basis for the following testing activities, including the automated derivation of executable test cases from it. Test cases can be derived statistically, randomly on the basis of operational profiles, and deterministically in order to perform different testing strategies. We have applied our approach with a large German OEM in different development stages of active safety and energy management functionalities.

The motivation is a smooth integration of formal techniques into an existing development cycle. Formal models are used to generate abstract test cases. These abstract tests are verified against requirement properties by means of model checking. The motivation for verifying the tests and not the model is two-fold: (1) in a typical safety-certification process the test cases are essential, not the models, (2) many common modelling tools do not provide a model checker. We refine the models, check refinement, and generate additional test cases capturing the newly added details. The final refinement step from a model to code is done with classical test-driven development. Hence, a developer implements one generated and formally verified test case after another, until all tests pass. The process is scalable to actual needs. Emphasis can be shifted between formal refinement of models and test-driven development. A car alarm system serves as a demonstrating case-study. We use Back's Action Systems as modelling language and mutation analysis for test case generation. We define refinement as input-output conformance (ioco). Model checking is done with the CADP toolbox. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications. All rights reserved."

As CPS are typically complex systems, its design process requires strong guarantees that the specified functional and non-functional properties are satisfied on the designed application. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and high-level specification languages are a valuable asset to help the design and evaluation of such complex systems. However, when looking at the existing MDE tool-support, it is observed that there is still little support for the automated integration of formal verification techniques in these tools. Given that formal verification is necessary to ensure the levels of reliability required by safety critical CPS, this paper presents an approach that aims to integrate the Model Checking technique in the CPS design process for the purpose of correctly analyzing temporal and safety characteristics. A tool named ECPS Verifier was designed to support the model checking integration into the design process, providing the generation of timed automata models from high-levels specifications in AADL. The proposed method is illustrated by means of the design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, from where we derive the timed automata models to be analyzed in the UPPAAL tool."

When the grid is in 'wind-diesel' mode, frequency regulation is (classically) the sole duty of the diesel electric generator (DEG). An alternative approach is proposed whereby responsibility for frequency regulation is shared by the DEG and a network of autonomous distributed secondary loads (DSLs) consisting of electric thermal storage (ETS) devices. This allows surplus wind to be distributed to residential consumers (as space heat) without the need for a centralized communication network. Numerical modeling of system dynamics with active DSLs is conducted using a SIMULINK wind-diesel hybrid test bed model. The effects of controller gain, installed capacity, switching time and unit coordination timing on frequency and voltage regulation is explored. It is shown that the DSLs can improve frequency regulation in wind-diesel mode while providing storable thermal energy to distributed consumers."

Agents interpret these models, at runtime, to choose alternative partners in collaboration or reusable components in computation, in an adaptive manner. Adopting an event-driven architecture at runtime, AAM has its agents and knowledge-based control readily applicable to robots and their on-board control extension.

Gesture control devices have recently emerged to be the next great gadgets for AR due to their unique ability to enable computer interaction with day-to-day gestures. While these AR devices are bringing revolutions to our interaction with the cyber world, it is also important to consider potential privacy leakages from these always-on wearable devices. Specifically, the coarse access control on current AR systems could lead to possible abuse of sensor data. Although the always-on gesture sensors are frequently quoted as a privacy concern, there has not been any study on information leakage of these devices. In this article, we present our study on side-channel information leakage of the most popular gesture control device, Myo. Using signals recorded from the electromyo-graphy (EMG) sensor and accelerometers on Myo, we can recover sensitive information such as passwords typed on a keyboard and PIN sequence entered through a touchscreen. EMG signal records subtle electric currents of muscle contractions. We design novel algorithms based on dynamic cumulative sum and wavelet transform to determine the exact time of finger movements. Furthermore, we adopt the Hudgins feature set in a support vector machine to classify recorded signal segments into individual fingers or numbers. We also apply coordinate transformation techniques to recover fine-grained spatial information with low-fidelity outputs from the sensor in keystroke recovery. We evaluated the information leakage using data collected from a group of volunteers. Our results show that there is severe privacy leakage from these commodity wearable sensors. Our system recovers complex passwords constructed with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols with a mean success rate of 91%."

Most existing approaches use shallow models and only work on static networks by extracting local or global topology information of each node as the algorithm input. It is challenging for such approaches to learn a desirable node representation on incomplete graphs with a large number of missing links or on dynamic graphs with new nodes joining in. It is even challenging for them to deeply fuse other types of data such as node properties into the learning process to help better represent the nodes with insufficient links. In this paper, we for the first time study the problem of network embedding on incomplete networks. We propose a Multi- View Correlation-learning based Deep Network Embedding method named MVC-DNE to incorporate both the network structure and the node properties for more effectively and efficiently perform network embedding on incomplete networks. Specifically, we consider the topology structure of the network and the node properties as two correlated views. The insight is that the learned representation vector of a node should reflect its characteristics in both views. Under a multi-view correlation learning based deep autoencoder framework, the structure view and property view embeddings are integrated and mutually reinforced through both self-view and cross-view learning. As MVC-DNE can learn a representation mapping function, it can directly generate the representation vectors for the new nodes without retraining the model. Thus it is especially more efficient than previous methods. Empirically, we evaluate MVC-DNE over three real network datasets on two data mining applications, and the results demonstrate that MVC-DNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

Formal specification for post-run analysis of log files, using a domain-specific language, LogScope, replaced scripted real-time analysis. Log analysis addresses the key problems of on-the-fly approaches and cleanly separates specification and execution. Mining the test repository suggested the inadequacy of the scripted approach, and encouraged a partly engineer-driven development. LogScope development should hold insights for others facing the tight deadlines and reactionary nature of testing for critical projects. LogScope received a JPL Mariner Award for ""improving productivity and quality of the MSL Flight Software"" and has been discussed as an approach for other flight missions. We note LogScope features that most contributed to ease of adoption and effectiveness. LogScope is general and can be applied to any software producing logs. © 2010 ACM."

Typically, the Simulink based development is initiated from Stateflow modeling, followed by simulation, validation and code generation mapped to physical execution platforms. However, recent industrial trends have raised the demands of rigorous verification on safety-critical applications, which is unfortunately challenging for Simulink. In this paper, we present an approach to bridge the Stateflow based model driven development and a well- defined rigorous verification. First, we develop a self- contained toolkit to translate Stateflow model into timed automata, where major advanced modeling features in Stateflow are supported. Taking advantage of the strong verification capability of Uppaal, we can not only find bugs in Stateflow models which are missed by Simulink Design Verifier, but also check more important temporal properties. Next, we customize a runtime verifier for the generated nonintrusive VHDL and C code of Stateflow model for monitoring. The major strength of the customization is the flexibility to collect and analyze runtime properties with a pure software monitor, which opens more opportunities for engineers to achieve high reliability of the target system compared with the traditional act that only relies on Simulink Polyspace. We incorporate these two parts into original Stateflow based MDD seamlessly. In this way, safety-critical properties are both verified at the model level, and at the consistent system implementation level with physical execution environment in consideration. We apply our approach on a train controller design, and the verified implementation is tested and deployed on a real hardware platform."

Nilsson offers a high-level programming model that permits the development of reactive systems, such as robotic vehicles. Teleo-Reactive programs are written in a manner that allows engineers to define the behaviour of the system while taking into account goals and changes in the state of the environment. This article presents a systematic approach that makes it possible to derive architectural models, with structural descriptions and behaviour, from Teleo-Reactive Programs. The development of reactive systems can therefore benefit significantly from a combination of two approaches: (1) the Teleo-Reactive approach, which is oriented towards a description of the system from the standpoint of the goals identified and the state of the environment and (2) the architectural approach, which is oriented towards the design of component-based software, in which decisions are conditioned by the need to reuse already tested solutions. The integration of this work into a development environment that allows code to be generated via model transformations opens up new possibilities in the development of this type of systems. The proposal is validated through a case study that is representative of the domain, and a survey carried out with post-graduate students. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

New intelligent approaches turning power distribution grids into Smart Grids are necessary. For their realization standardized automation, control and communication systems are essential. Moreover, an integrated engineering approach for the development of Smart Grid applications using these standards is equally required. Model-driven engineering methods well known from computer science together with implementation methods from automation domain have the potential to provide the basis for such a required integrated engineering concept. The main aim of this paper therefore is to facilitate the integration of legacy Smart Grid applications into a model-driven engineering approach. It introduces transformation rules for the conversion of applications implemented with textual programming languages into the IEC 61499 reference model. A brief overview of existing model-driven approaches applied in industrial environments is provided and their applicability for Smart Grid application development is discussed. The special requirements of the Smart Grid domain is taken into account by the proposed transformation approach and provided examples."

The extension mechanism is provided by UML profiles for RTES and it aims at improving an easily-understood method of system design for non-experts. One of the key items of the co-design methods is the Hardware/Software partitioning and scheduling tasks. Indeed, it is mandatory to define where and when tasks are implemented and run. Unfortunately, the main goals of co-design are not included in the usual practice of UML profiles. So, there exists a need for mapping used models to an execution platform for both schedulability test and HW/SW partitioning. In the present work, test schedulability and design space exploration are performed at an early stage. The proposed approach adopts Model Driven Engineering MDE. It starts from UML specification annotated with the recent profile for the Modeling and Analysis of Real Time Embedded systems MARTE. Following refinement strategy, transformation rules allow the finding of a feasible schedule that satisfies timing constraints and defining where tasks will be implemented. The overall approach is experimented on the design of a football player robot application."

We formulate the tasks as linear temporal logic specifications and encode them into an optimization framework via mixed-integer constraints. Both the system dynamics and the specifications are known but affected by uncertainty. The distribution of the uncertainty is unknown, however realizations can be obtained. We introduce a data-driven approach where the constraints are fulfilled for a set of realizations and provide probabilistic generalization guarantees as a function of the number of considered realizations. We use separate chance constraints for the satisfaction of the specification and operational constraints. This allows us to quantify their violation probabilities independently. We compute disturbance feedback policies as solutions of mixed-integer linear or quadratic optimization problems. By using feedback we can exploit information of past realizations and provide feasibility for a wider range of situations compared to static input sequences. We demonstrate the proposed method on two robust motion-planning case studies for autonomous driving."

The first design area among these, the topology, has the biggest flexibility of them all, yet, so far in the literature, the topology design is limited investigated due to its high complexity. In practice, a predefined small set of topologies is used to optimize their energy efficiency by varying the power specifications of the main components (sizing). By doing so, the complete design of the vehicle is, inherently and to a certain extent, suboptimal. Moreover, various complex topologies appear on the automotive market and no tool exists to optimally choose or evaluate them. To overcome this design limitation, in this paper, a novel framework is presented that deals with the automatic generation of possible topologies given a set of components (e.g., engine, electric machine, batteries, or transmission elements). This paper uses a platform (library of components) and a hybrid knowledge base (functional and cost-based principles) to set up a constraint logic programming problem, and outputs a set of feasible topologies for hybrid electric vehicles. These are all possible topologies that could be built considering a fixed, yet large, set of components. Then, by using these results, insights are given on what construction principles are mostly critical for simulations time, and what topologies could be selected as candidate topologies for sizing and control studies. Such a framework can be used for any powertrain application; it can offer the topologies to be investigated in the design phase and can provide insightful results for optimal design analyses."

As an application, a set of functional metamodels is proposed for dataflows (usable to model continuous behaviors), state-transition systems (usable to model discrete behaviors) and a metamodel for actions (to model interactions with a target platform and concurrent execution).

Theory explains the domains in which we operate, the phenomena found in those domains, and the ways in which they might be affected by manipulation or change. Theory is derived from the deliberate, self-conscious, and controlled observation of phenomena, whether this has taken place in the positivist empirical paradigm or in the qualitative paradigm. In knowledge organization, the generation of theory has moved from an epistemic stance of pragmatism, based on observation of the construction of retrieval tools, to empiricism, based on the results of empirical research. In three areas, research has accumulated to a degree sufficient to approach the positing of preliminary theoretical statements. These are: 1) author productivity and the distribution of name headings; 2) the work phenomenon; and 3) external validity. Research in these areas is examined, leading to the positing of three preliminary theoretical statements. These are: 1) most names in bibliographic databases will occur only once, and a very small number, which can be predicted by Lotka's Law, will occur many times; 2) the work phenomenon reflects an association with Lotka's Law, such that many works exist in only one instantiation, but a large proportion evolves steadily over time; and 3) there is a beginning of evidence that there are grounds for external validity in the examination of knowledge entities. Further domain-specific analysis in each of these areas is necessary to lead to strengthened predictive capability of theory that might emerge. Other theoretical statements might soon be possible. Such explanations could give us real predictive power for the development of sophisticated systems for the retrieval of knowledge entities. © The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science / La Revue Canadienne des Sciences de l'Information et de Bibliothéconomie, 2001."

We suggest that such effects actually reflect processing demands arising when items with similar representations must be finely discriminated. In a positron emission tomography (PET) study of category verification with colored photographs of animals and vehicles, there was robust animal-specific activation in the lateral posterior fusiform gyri when stimuli were categorized at an intermediate level of specificity (e.g., dog or car). However, when the same photographs were categorized at a more specific level (e.g., Labrador or BMW), these regions responded equally strongly to animals and vehicles. We conclude that the lateral posterior fusiform does not encode domain-specific representations of animals or visual properties characteristic of animals. Instead, these regions are strongly activated whenever an item must be discriminated from many close visual or semantic competitors. Apparent category effects arise because, at an intermediate level of specificity, animals have more visual and semantic competitors than do artifacts. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

The model is processed by our game-based synthesis engine, from which intermediate code is generated. By mapping each behavioral-level action to a sequence of low-level PLC control commands, we transform the intermediate code into an executable program.

Rather than using gradient-based search methods, the multi-agent swarm is clustered to partially deal with the dimensionality curse. Each cluster is end-to-end connected and its area of responsibility is assigned based on its collective Voronoi tessellation. This area is then coarsely sampled and a game-theoretic approach is employed relying on fictitious play amongst the cluster’s members. The search scheme is then switched into a fine-spatial sampling and initialized using the previously attained coarse optimal positions of the agents. The provided adaptive-size game-theoretic optimization search approach provides the optimal location of the agents with a tenfold faster convergence compared to the gradient-search methods. Simulation studies are offered to highlight the efficiency of the search scheme."

Patchouli alcohol (PA), a tricyclic sesquiterpene, is the major active constituent of Pogostemonis Herba. This study aimed to investigate the possible anti-ulcerogenic potential of PA and the underlying mechanism against ethanol, indomethacin and water immersion restraint-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Gross and histological gastric lesions, biochemical and immunological parameters were taken into consideration. The gastric mucus content and the antisecretory activity were analyzed through pylorus ligature model in rats. Results indicated that oral administration with PA significantly reduced the ulcer areas induced by ethanol, indomethacin and water immersion restraint. PA pretreatment significantly promoted gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and non-protein sulfhydryl group (NP-SH) levels, upregulated the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression, and considerably boosted the gastric blood flow (GBF) and gastric mucus production in comparison with vehicle. In addition, PA modulated the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and malonaldehyde (MDA) were also restored by PA. However, the gastric secretion parameters (pH, volume of gastric juice and pepsin) did not show any significant alteration. These findings suggest that PA exhibited significant gastroprotective effects against gastric ulceration. The underlying mechanisms might involve the stimulation of COX-mediated PGE2, improvement of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status, preservation of GBF and NP-SH, as well as boost of gastric mucus production."

Such collaborations are usually regulated by commitment protocols, which are typically defined at design-time. However, agent commitments among the participants to meld collaborative patterns typically defined in static environments, which may not fit the need of ACSs. To address this, we propose a Goal-Capability-Commitment (GCC) based mediation for agents collaboration at run-time that combines invalid diagnoser, capability reconciliation and commitment compensation. We elaborate on each of GCC elements, focusing in particular on the feasibility afforded by (1) the ability to diagnose the failures of capability and commitment leaded by the changing environments, and (2) the ability of mediation to select appropriate capability or generate new commitment in order to satisfy the invalid goals. We represent the GCC model in a hospital medical waste AGV transportation case study and illustrate our approach through experiments."

The approach focuses on the interaction between the hopper and its surroundings at points of contact. It is only through reactions at contact points that a hopper can alter its momenta. A generalization of the virtual leg abstraction allows control programs to be expressed as constraints on the external forces and torques acting on the hopper. The relationship between the nature of the external contacts and motion control strategies is investigated. The approach was tested in simulation using the model-driven dynamic simulator Newton. The experiments demonstrate the utility of simulation for studying physical control problems. Through simulation, a broad range of design parameters can be easily tested to determine the limits of the control strategy."

In this work, we propose FitnessStudio, a technique for generating efficient problem-tailored mutation operators automatically based on a two-tier framework. The lower tier is a regular meta-heuristic search whose mutation operator is “trained” by an upper-tier search using a higher-order model transformation.

In order to clarify these mechanisms, we investigate the stability characteristics of walking using a five-link planar biped robot with a torso and knee joints that has an internal oscillator with a stable limit cycle to generate the joint motions. Herein we conduct numerical simulations and a stability analysis, where we analytically obtain approximate periodic solutions and examine local stability using a Poincaré map. These analyses reveal (1) stability characteristics due to locomotion speed, torso, and knee motion, (2) stability improvement due to the modulation of oscillator states based on phase resetting using foot-contact information, and (3) the optimal parameter in the oscillator dynamics for adequately exploiting the interactions among the robot dynamics, the oscillator dynamics, and the environment in order to increase walking stability.

GeneSIS-Rtameliorates the burden of having to collect labeled real-world images and is a promising candidate for generating high-quality, domain-specific, synthetic data.

Genesys is an integral part of jABC, a flexible framework designed to enable a systematic model-driven development of systems and applications on the basis of an (extensible) library of well-defined, reusable building blocks. Within jABC, Genesys manages the construction of code generators for jABC's models. So far, Genesys has been used to develop code generators for a variety of different target platforms, like a number of Java-based platforms, mobile devices, BPEL engines, etc. Since the code generators are themselves built within the jABC in a model-driven way, concepts like bootstrapping and reuse of existing components enable a fast evolution of Genesys' code generation library, and a high degree of self-application. Due to its increasing complexity and its high degree of reuse, Genesys profits from model checking-based verification. This way, jABC's models of code generators can be automatically checked wrt. well-formedness properties, to ensure that the models do indeed only consist of building blocks which are suitable for the considered target platforms, and whose versions are mutually compatible. It can be also be verified that the code generation process only starts after a successful initialization phase, and that the generated code is always packaged with all the required libraries. We will illustrate the ease of extension and flexibility of the Genesys framework by describing the intended coverage of diversity while highlighting the high potential of reuse. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008."

Many applications such as service and assistive robots require constant movement between different regions along with accurate navigation and localization at any point in time. Algorithms for SLAM have matured greatly over the last few years and can accommodate different sensors, computing requirements as well as environments for use. However, for long-term autonomy indoors, reasoning with a large volume of RGB-D data is still a major challenge. In this work, we propose a pipeline that attributes semantics, more specifically cuboidal structure, to observed objects, uses them as landmarks for mapping and thereby reduces the dimensionality of the represented map greatly. We chose cuboids, because many common urban scenes (such as offices, homes, malls) contain cuboidal objects (such as cabinets, tables, shelves). We develop a metric to perform such attribution consistently so they can be used as landmarks for mapping/navigation. We have tested our pipeline on three different datasets and show that we can reduce the map representation significantly while maintaining localization accuracy in all of them. Our vision is that attributing low-level semantics such as one presented in this work would make long-term autonomy computationally tractable."

One key challenge posed by Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DASs) is the need to handle changes to the requirements and corresponding behavior of a DAS in response to varying environmental conditions. Berry et al. previously identified four levels of RE that should be performed for a DAS. In this paper, we propose the Levels of RE for Modeling that reify the original levels to describe RE modeling work done by DAS developers. Specifically, we identify four types of developers: the system developer, the adaptation scenario developer, the adaptation infrastructure developer, and the DAS research community. Each level corresponds to the work of a different type of developer to construct goal model(s) specifying their requirements. We then leverage the Levels of RE for Modeling to propose two complementary processes for performing RE for a DAS.

Due to the inherently unstable inverted pendulum-like dynamics of walking, the design of robust walking controllers proved to be particularly challenging. While a controller could potentially be learned with a robot in the loop, the destructive nature of losing balance and the impracticality of a high number of repetitions render most existing learning methods unsuitable for an online learning setting with real hardware. We propose a model-driven learning method that enables a humanoid robot to quickly learn how to maintain its balance. We bootstrap the learning process with a central pattern generator for stepping motions that abstracts from the complexity of the walking motion and simplifies the problem setting to the learning of a small number of leg swing amplitude parameters. A simple physical model that represents the dominant dynamics of bipedal walking estimates an approximate gradient and suggests how to modify the swing amplitude to restore balance. In experiments with a real robot, we show that only a few failed steps are sufficient for our biped to learn strong push recovery skills in the sagittal direction."

The model-driven development movement therefore aims at improving the longevity of software by keeping the development artifacts more consistent and better changeable by employing models and to a certain degree automated model operations. Another trend are systems that tackle the challenge at runtime by being able to adapt their structure and behavior to be more flexible and operate in more dynamic environments (e.g., context-aware software, autonomic computing, self-adaptive software). Finally, models at runtime, where the benefits of model-driven development are employed at runtime to support adaptation capabilities, today lead towards a unification of both ideas. In this paper, we present graph transformations and show that they can be employed to engineer solutions for all three outlined cases. Furthermore, we will even be able to demonstrate that graph transformation based technology has the potential to also unify all three cases in a single scenario where models at runtime and runtime adaptation is linked with classical MDE. Therefore, we at first provide an introduction in graph transformations, then present the related techniques of Story Pattern and Triple Graph Grammars, and demonstrate how with the help of both techniques model transformations, adaptation behavior and runtime model framework work.

To capture this knowledge explicitly and formally in the form of various domain models, roboticists have recently employed model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. However, these models are merely seen as a way to support humans during the robot's software design process. We argue that the robots themselves should be first-class consumers of this knowledge to autonomously adapt their software to the various and changing run-time requirements induced, for instance, by the robot's tasks or environment. Motivated by knowledge-enabled approaches, we address this problem by employing a graph-based knowledge representation that allows us not only to persistently store domain models, but also to formulate powerful queries for the sake of run time adaptation. We have evaluated our approach in an integrated, real-world system using the neo4j graph database and we report some lessons learned. Further, we show that the graph database imposes only little overhead on the system's overall performance."

The environment guides the search process by generating immediate rewards based on fresh cost estimates, for either the entirety or a sample of queries from the workload, and by deciding the possible actions given a state. This set of actions is configurable, enabling the representation of different partitioning problems.

In the present study, R. communis was found more tolerant to salinity and drought in presence of Cd and removed more Cd in a given time than Indian mustard. R. communis produced 23 and twelve folds higher biomass in terms of fresh weight and dry weight, respectively than that in B. juncea during three months when grown in Cd contaminated soil in presence of 100mM NaCl salinity and ten day water withdrawal based drought at 90 day after sowing (DAS). Castor plants showed stronger self-protection ability in form of proline bioaccumulation (r2=0.949) than Indian mustard (r2=0.932), whereas a lower r2 for malondialdehyde (MDA) and total soluble protein in R. communis (r2=0.914 and r2=0.915, respectively) than that of B. juncea (r2=0.947 and r2=0.927, respectively) indicated a greater damage to cell membrane in Indian mustard during the multiple stress conditions. Though, the amount of Cd accumulated in the roots and shoots of Indian mustard was higher as per unit biomass than that in castor, total removal of the metal from soil was much higher in castor on per plant basis in the same period in presence of the stresses. R. communis accumulated about seventeen and 1.5 fold higher Cd in their roots and shoots, respectively than that of B. juncea in 90 DAS under the multiple stresses. Salinity alone enhanced Cd uptake, whereas drought stress reduced its uptake in both the plants. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

The major constituent of gugulipid is guggulsterone [4, 17 (20)-pregnadiene-3, 16-dione]. It has been observed recently that patients receiving lipid-lowering drugs like statins have a reduced risk of dementia. Therefore, the present study was planned to explore the potential of gugulipid as cognitive enhancer. Gugulipid (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) showed dose dependent improvement in scopolamine-induced deficits in passive avoidance test. The maximal effective dose of gugulipid i.e. 50 mg/kg, p.o. was used for further studies on streptozotocin (STZ) model of dementia in mice. Gugulipid was investigated for its effect on learning and memory, parameters of oxidative stress (GSH and MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the STZ (ic)-treated mice. Intracerebral (ic) injections of STZ (0.5 mg/kg) on 1st and 3rd day caused significant deficit in memory in passive avoidance and Morris water maze test after the 14th day of first dose. In passive avoidance, transfer latency time (TLT) was not increased on retention trials in STZ (ic) group while gugulipid treatment resulted in significant increase in TLT on retention trials in STZ (ic)-treated mice. In Morris water maze test the latency time to reach platform in STZ (ic)-treated mice was significantly higher than control and vehicle (artificial CSF). Pre-treatment of gugulipid (50 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 14 days started with the first dose of STZ (ic), significantly prevented STZ (ic)-induced memory deficit. Post-treatment i.e. after 14 days of first dose of STZ (ic) of gugulipid (50 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased the latency time indicating anti-dementia activity. Effect of gugulipid and STZ in visible platform test was similar to those seen with hidden platform. Gugulipid and STZ-treated mice did not cause significant change in locomotor activity. Furthermore, STZ (ic) resulted into increase in AChE activity, low level of GSH and high concentration of MDA in brain on 21st day as compared to control. Gugulipid treatment caused significant decrease in AChE activity, low level of MDA and high concentration of GSH in brain following STZ (ic) as compared to vehicle administration in STZ (ic)-treated mice. The study demonstrated that gugulipid has significant protective affect against streptozotocin-induced memory deficits model of dementia that can be attributed to anti-oxidant and anti-AChE activity of gugulipid. These observations suggest gugulipid as a potential anti-dementia drug (CDRI, Lucknow has obtained US patent No. 6896901 for use of gugulipid as cognitive enhancer). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These are generated by manipulating a virtual camera and lighting when rendering a realistic 3D model of a human to methodically explore the parameter space. A camera application uses the models to estimate the aesthetic quality of a live selfie preview based on parameters measured by computer vision.

The second stage regulator or mouthpiece is equipped with a circuit to pick up the voice of the diver. Then the voice is frequency-modulates into ultrasonic signal to be transmitted into water. A receiver on the other side picks up the ultrasonic signal and demodulates it back to voice, and plays back in diver's earphone set. This technology is mature but not widely adopted for its price. Most divers still use their favorite way to communicate with each other, i.e. DSL (divers' sign language.) As more and more intelligent machines or robots are built to help divers for their underwater task, divers not only need to exchange messages with their human partners but also machines. However, it seems that there are not many input devices available other than push buttons or joysticks. We know that divers' hands are always busy with holding tools or gauges. Additional input devices will further complicate their movement, also distract their attention for safety measures. With this consideration, this paper intends to develop an algorithm to read the DSL as input commands for computer-aided diving system."

As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. However, current solutions can only handle pre-specified requirements either in the form of setpoint values (S-reqs) or values to be optimized (O-reqs). This paper presents SimCA∗ that makes two contributions to control-based self-adaptation: (a) it allows the user to specify a third type of requirement that keeps a value above/below a threshold (T-reqs), and (b) it can deal with requirement sets that change at runtime (i.e., requirements can be adjusted, activated, and deactivated on the fly). SimCA∗ offers robustness to disturbances and provides adaptation guarantees. We evaluate SimCA∗ for two systems with strict goals from different domains: an underwater vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance, and a tele-assistance system for health care support. The test results demonstrate that SimCA∗ can deal with the three types of requirements (STO-reqs) operating under various types of dynamics and the set of requirements can be changed on the fly."

In many cases, the result of these automated activities is an overwhelming amount of information. This is the case of one-to-many model transformations that, e.g. in model-based design-space exploration, can potentially generate a massive amount of candidate models (i.e., solution space) from one single source model. In our scenario, from one design model we generate a set of possible implementation models on which timing analysis is run. The aim is to find the best model from a timing perspective. However, multiple implementation models can have equally good analysis results. Therefore, the engineer is expected to investigate the solution space for making a final decision, using criteria which fall outside the analysis' criteria themselves. Since candidate models can be many and very similar to each other, manually finding differences and commonalities is an impractical and error-prone task. In order to provide the engineer with an expressive representation of models' commonalities and differences, we propose the use of modelling with uncertainty. We achieve this by elevating the solution space to a first-class status, adopting a compact notation capable of representing the solution space by means of a single model with uncertainty. Commonalities and differences are thus represented by means of uncertainty points for the engineer to easily grasp them and consistently make her decision without manually inspecting each model individually."

Clarity in communicating resumption of control is important to avoiding conflicts between driver and vehicle, which could result in road accidents. In this paper, we draw from the field of robotics to inform solutions to communicate resumption of control for automotive interaction design."

Recognizing dance steps with fine granularity using wearables is one of those exciting applications. In a typical dance classroom scenario where the instructors are frequently outnumbered by the students, accelerometer sensors can be utilized to automatically compare the performance of the dancers and provide informative feedback to all the stakeholders, for example the instructors and the learners. However, owing to the complexity of the movement kinematics of human body, building a sufficiently accurate and reliable system can be a daunting task. Utilization of multiple sensors can help improve the reliability, however most wearable sensors do not boast sufficient resolution for such tasks and often suffer from various data sampling, device heterogeneity and instability issues. To address these challenges, we introduce HappyFeet, a convolutional neural network based deep, self-evolving feature learning model that accurately recognizes the micro steps of various dance activities. We show that our model consistently outperforms feature engineering based shallow learning approaches by a margin ∼ 7% accuracy on data collected from dance routines (Indian classical) performed by a professional dancer. We also posit a Body Sensor Network model and discuss the underpinning challenges and possible solutions associated with multiple sensors' signal variations."

The specific feature of this domain is that we should handle not only the pixel-by-pixel 2D processing in one image but also the 3D processing for depth estimation by comparing information about a scene from several images with different perspectives. This feature brings challenges to memory resource utilization, because an extra dimension of data has to be buffered. Due to the memory limitation, few of previous stereo vision implementations provide both accurate and high-speed processing for high-resolution images at the same time. To achieve domain-specific acceleration for stereo vision, the memory limitation has to be addressed. This article uses a Mini-Census ADaptive Support Region (MCADSR) stereo matching algorithm as a case study due to its high accuracy and representative operations in this domain. To relieve the memory limitation and achieve high-speed processing, the article proposes several efficient optimization methods including vertical-first cost aggregation, hybrid parallel processing, and hardware-friendly integral image. The article also presents a customizable system which provides both accurate and high-speed stereo matching for highresolution images. The benefits of applying the optimization methods to the system are highlighted. With the aforesaid optimization and specific customization implemented on FPGA, the demonstrated system can process 47.6 fps (frames per second) and 129 fps for video size of 1920×1080 with a large disparity range of 256 and 1024 × 768 with a disparity range of 128, respectively. Our results are up to 1.64 times better than previous work in terms of Million Disparity Estimation per second (MDE/s).

Generating mobile agents from a workflow specification is the responsibility of a context-aware compiler. Hermes is structured as a component-based, agent-oriented system with a 3-layer software architecture. It can be configured for specific application domains by adding domain-specific component libraries. The Hermes middleware layer, compilers, libraries, services and other developed tools together result in a very general programming environment, which has been validated in two quite disparate application domains, one in industrial control and the other in bioinformatics. In the industrial control domain, embedded systems with scarce computational resources control product lines. Mobile agents are used to trace products and support self-healing.

The Dempster-Shafer formalism is used for associating belief values with the different possible labels for the constructed abstractions in the perceived image.

The system can unsupervisedly learn normal activity and then report novel behavioral patterns as abnormal. The learning stage is based on the clustering of motion with self-organizing maps. With this approach, no domain-specific knowledge on normal actions is required. During the tracking stage, we extract human motion properties expressed in terms of multidimensional flow vectors. From this representation, three classes of motion descriptors are encoded: trajectories, body features and directions. During the training phase, SOM networks are responsible for learning a specific class of descriptors. For a more accurate clustering of motion, we detect and remove outliers from the training data. At detection time, we propose a hybrid neural-statistical method for 3D posture recognition in real time. New observations are tested for novelty and reported if they deviate from the learned behavior. Experiments were performed in two different tracking scenarios with fixed and mobile depth sensor. In order to exhibit the validity of the proposed methodology, several experimental setups and the evaluation of obtained results are presented. © 2013 IEEE."

In this scheme, the output of a third semiconductor laser is used as the common signal driving the other two identical lasers with self-feedback to be synchronized. To enhance the bandwidth of the chaotic signal employing in the communication, part of output of the driven laser is coupled into the third laser and appropriate frequency detuning is also considered. Since the relative strong wide-bandwidth optical injection, the native time delay signature of chaos generated by the driven laser is suppressed. Moreover, the results shows that high-speed chaotic communication over 10Gb/s can be achieved due to the enhancement of the chaotic bandwidth."

Recently, these non-functional requirements are addressed using self-adaptivity features, that is, the system monitors its environment and adjusts its structure or behavior in reaction to changes. In classical model-driven software engineering approaches, self-adaptivity introduces additional complexity since self-adaptation features are distributed in a cross-cutting manner at various different locations in the models, resulting in a tightly interwoven model landscape that is hard to understand and maintain. A particular solution to cope with this problem is the separation of concerns (SoC) to focus on the specific concern of self-adaptivity and allow in-depth analyses. Applying SoC requires suitable development processes, languages, and techniques, e.g., for quality assurance, to be available. In this paper, we present a method for the specification of self-adaptive software systems using a UML based concern-specific modeling language called Adapt Case Modeling Language (ACML) that allows the separated and explicit specification of self-adaptivity concerns. Based on formal semantics we show how to apply quality assurance techniques to the modeled self-adaptive system, which enable the provisioning of hard guarantees concerning self-adaptivity characteristics such as adaptation rule set stability and deadlock freedom. Further, we show how the language and techniques integrate with existing software development processes. © 2013 IEEE."

Given that we make choices multiple times per day, hourly and daily patterns are critical for better understanding behaviors. Here, we combine natural language processing, machine learning and time series analyses to assess Twitter activity specifically related to alcohol and tobacco consumption and their sub-daily, daily and weekly cycles. Twitter self-reports of alcohol and tobacco use are compared to other data streams available at similar temporal resolution. We assess if discussion of drinking by inferred underage versus legal age people or discussion of use of different types of tobacco products can be differentiated using these temporal patterns. We find that time and frequency domain representations of behaviors on social media can provide meaningful and unique insights, and we discuss the types of behaviors for which the approach may be most useful."

The objective is to benefit from the multimodal perception allowing to improve the quality and robustness of challenging applications such as the advanced driver assistance, 3-D vision, inspection systems or military observation equipment. However, the multiplication of heterogeneous processing pipelines makes the design of efficient computing resources for the multi-sensor systems very arduous task. In addition to the context of latency critical application and limited power budget, the designer has often to consider the parameters of sensors varying dynamically as well as the number of active sensors used at the moment. To optimize the computing resource management, we inspire from the self-aware architectures. We propose an original on-chip monitor, completed by an observation and command network-on-chip allowing the system resources supervision and their on-the-fly adaptation. We present the evaluation of the proposed monitoring solution through FPGA implementation. We estimate the cost of the proposed solution in the terms of surface occupation and latency. And finally, we show that the proposed solution guarantees a processing of 1080p resolution frames at more than 60 fps."

Even though functions of embedded systems such as in-vehicle systems are largely the same for each country, the HMI design has to be customized to specific languages and requirements. For instance, adjusting the width and font of text improves its visibility. However, this creates a new issue regarding HMI design management. We report here on HMI development of derived products, which are assumed to be developed with common functions and customized HMI, by using a model-driven prototyping tool for in-vehicle systems. The prototyping tool we developed is based on open source software including an image editor, Eclipse plug-in, relational database, servlet, and Web browser. In addition, XML for the prototyping tool is defined in order to represent derived product support features.

Dynamic services are services that are not known at design/deploy time of the HMI (human machine interaction) software of the automobile. Such services will increasingly find their way into the modern car: via mobile consumer electronics, via online servers, or via software download. In order for the driver to safely and comfortably interact with these services, their user interfaces need to be seamlessly integrated into the overall HMI system of the car and resemble the look and feel of the statically deployed HMI system. In the approach described in this paper, each service is accompanied by a description of its semantics, based on which a generic UI generator then automatically designs an appropriate UI and integrates it into the existing HMI system. We use OWL to formulate the domain-specific ontology of automotive infotainment services and OWL-S to describe the service interfaces. In order to be able to express listener/notification semantics, we extended OWL-S by several new constructs. Our results are based on our implementation of a UI generator for an automotive infotainment system, using the typical BMW Group HMI concepts. © 2007 IEEE."

First, a literature review on automotive interfaces concerning methodology application is outlined showing that studies often lack to provide both self-report and observational data. To derive a comprehensive image of HMI quality, we recommend multi-method approach in user research. Subsequently, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art self-report and observational measures.

Using arrows (a generalization of monads), one can ""wire together"" processes in a manner analogous to a signal-processing application. The processes themselves are typically existing C or C++ programs, but may also be programs written in a first-order sub-language in Haskell that supports basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, and other related operations. In both cases, once the processes are wired together, the supporting Haskell implementation is out of the loop - imported C programs run unimpeded, the Haskell sub-language is compiled into C code, and all data paths run directly between C processes. But in addition, HPorter's event-driven reactivity permits reconfiguration of these tightly-coupled processes at any time, thus providing a degree of dynamism that is critical in many applications. The advantages of our approach over conventional scripting languages include a higher degree of type safety, a declarative style, dynamic reconfiguration of processes, having the full power of Haskell, and portability across operating systems. We have implemented HPorter both on the QNX operating system and using conventional TCP/IP sockets, and are using it in a practical application in Yale's Humanoid Robotics Laboratory, where the processes correspond to soft-real-time tasks such as computer vision, motor control, planning, and limb kinematics. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."

We postulate a restrictive scenario where a low-cost processor is in charge of both flying the UAV and resolving data communication. This raises the need for safe trade-off of computing resources between stability and throughput, adapting to unpredictable environment changes. We present a strategy where a supervisory controller implements an adaptive relaxation of the sampling period of the UAV regulation controller to favor communication tasks. To guarantee stability under period switching we update the discrete-time control law with suitable gains. The resulting system comprises continuous, discrete-time and discrete-event dynamics, including event-based adaptation of the discrete-time controller. We show how the DEVS modeling and simulation framework can support a full simulation-based design, verification and validation process, featuring a seamless composition of the underlying hybrid domains."

As interaction between the driver and in cabin technologies increases it is beneficial to provide tailored driver communication for an improved cabin experience. Assessment of the driving demand is of particular value to assist in modulating communication and vehicle system interactions with the driver. The complex vehicle, driver, and environment driving contexts require innovative prognostic approaches to driver workload inference.

Accordingly, it consists of two stages: (1) clustering neural network (CNN) stage and (2) output neural network (ONN) stage. CNN categorizes input sample into an appropriate cluster, which is identical to finding a relevant rule to be fired in knowledge base. Then in ONN stage, ONNs are built based on information about the clusters derived from CNN stage, and used to make a final decision: 'bankrupt' or 'non-bankrupt'. CNN uses two types of unsupervised neural network models for pattern clustering, SOM (Self-Organizing Map) and LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization), and then learns the clusters in a supervised manner. ONN utilizes a supervised neural network. To prove the performance of proposed HYNEN model more rigorously, we performed comparative experiments with Korean bankruptcy data using MDA (Multivariate Discriminant Analysis), ACLS (Analog Concept Learning System), conventional neural network approach. Experimental results show that the proposed HYNEN model performs the best among three other methods."

The objective of this article is designing and implementing a traffic prediction scheme which can forecast the traffic flow with high efficiency and accuracy in Hong Kong. One problem in traffic prediction is how to balance the importance of historical traffic data and real-time traffic data. To make use of the real-time data as well as the history records, our ideas are combining data-driven approaches with model-driven approaches. First, the limitations of two baseline approaches auto-regressive integrated moving average and periodical moving average model are discussed. Second, artificial neural network is applied in the hybrid prediction model to balance between the two models. The training of neural network enables the artificial neural network to weight between real-time traffic data and traffic patterns revealed by historical traffic data. Furthermore, an emergency strategy using the Bayesian network is added to the prediction scheme to handle with the traffic accident or other emergent situation. The emergency prediction strategy on unexpected traffic situation considers the traffic condition of nearby links to predict the speed change on the link. Finally, experimental results of short-term and long-term predictions demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme."

Insoluble anticancer drug, CPT, was easily encapsulated into HGC nanoparticles by a dialysis method and the drug loading efficiency was above 80%. CPT-encapsulated HGC (CPT-HGC) nanoparticles formed nano-sized self-aggregates in aqueous media (280-330 nm in diameter) and showed sustained release of CPT for 1 week. Also, HGC nanoparticles effectively protected the active lactone ring of CPT from the hydrolysis under physiological condition, due to the encapsulation of CPT into the hydrophobic cores in the HGC nanoparticles. The CPT-HGC nanoparticles exhibited significant antitumor effects and high tumor targeting ability towards MDA-MB231 human breast cancer xenografts subcutaneously implanted in nude mice. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited after i.v. injection of CPT-HGC nanoparticles at doses of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, compared to free CPT at dose of 30 mg/kg. The significant antitumor efficacy of CPT-HGC nanoparticles was attributed to the ability of the nanoparticles to show both prolonged blood circulation and high accumulation in tumors, as confirmed by near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging systems. Thus, the delivery of CPT to tumor tissues at a high concentration, with the assistance of HGC nanoparticles, exerted a potent therapeutic effect. These results reveal the promising potential of HGC nanoparticles-encapsulated CPT as a stable and effective drug delivery system in cancer therapy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, given that clinical applications require reliable sensing, there is a need to understand how accurate healthcare sensors on wearable devices (e.g., heart rate sensors) are. To answer this question, this work starts with a thorough investigation on the accuracy of widely used wearable devices' heart rate sensors. Specifically, we show that when actively moving, heart rate readings can diverge far from the ground truth, and also show that such inaccuracies cannot be easily correlated, nor predicted, using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Rather, we point out that the light intensity readings at the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor can be an effective indicator of heart rate accuracy. Using a Viterbi algorithm-based Hidden Markov Model, we show that it is possible to design a filter that allows smartwatches to self-classify measurement quality with ∼ 98% accuracy. Given that such capabilities allow the smartwatch to internally filter misleading values from being application input, we foresee this as an essential step in catalyzing novel clinical-grade wearable applications."

While these activity tracking applications have the potential to improve our health, user engagement and retention are critical factors for their success. However, long-term user engagement patterns in real-world activity tracking applications are not yet well understood. Here we study user engagement patterns within a mobile physical activity tracking application consisting of 115 million logged activities taken by over a million users over 31 months. Specifically, we show that over 75% of users return and re-engage with the application after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matter the duration of the inactivity. We find a surprising result that the re-engagement usage patterns resemble those of the start of the initial engagement period, rather than being a simple continuation of the end of the initial engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model of multiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single life view of user activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives occur because the users have a variety of different primary intents or goals for using the app. These primary intents are associated with how long each life lasts and how likely the user is to re-engage for a new life. We find evidence for users being more likely to stop using the app once they achieved their primary intent or goal (e.g., weight loss). However, these users might return once their original intent resurfaces (e.g., wanting to lose newly gained weight). We discuss implications of the multiple life paradigm and propose a novel prediction task of predicting the number of lives of a user. Based on insights developed in this work, including a marker of improved primary intent performance, our prediction models achieve 71% ROC AUC. Overall, our research has implications for modeling user re-engagement in health activity tracking applications and has consequences for how notifications, recommendations as well as gamification can be used to increase engagement."

The vendors of smartphones support different platforms hence to reach as many users as possible, the developer has to develop the same application for all these platforms using the different tools and programming languages provided by each platform vendor. Therefore the cross-platform mobile applications development solutions were introduced to develop the application once and run it everywhere. The cross-platform solutions use different approaches for native development such as cross-compilation, Model-Driven Development...etc. None of these approaches claim that it provides a complete solution as they are still under research and development. This paper introduces a new integrated cross-platform mobile development solution that merges between different approaches to benefit from the advantages and minimize the drawbacks of each approach. The main contributions include: explore the approaches used in designing the new solution, explain the research methodology and the new solution architecture along with the implementation, and evaluate the limitations of the new proposed architecture and implementation compared to known solutions. The results show substantial improvement over existing solutions."

An algorithmic procedure is then developed, for the computation of the unknown system matrices, based on a standard deterministic linear subspace identification algorithm, provided the input signal has some persistent excitation properties.

It represents a wicked problem with no “correct” solutions or “right” answers; the quality and success of design solutions are not only a question of fact, but a question of value and interests of the involved stakeholders. Design trade-offs are the most basic characteristics of design. They are universal and they make us aware that there are “no decontextualized sweet spots”. In contrast to design guidelines, they widen rather than narrow design spaces by (1) avoiding simple solutions to complex problems and (2) by identifying and exploring interesting new approaches with the objective to synthesize the strengths and reduce the weaknesses of the binary choices defining the trade-offs. The paper articulates a conceptual framework for human-centered design focused on a design trade-off perspective. The framework is inspired from a brief analysis of design trade-offs in large scale developments (self-driving cars, sharing economy, and big data). Based on our own research activities, it is elaborated with specific design trade-offs (context-aware information delivery, meta-design, and cultures of participation) and further illustrated with the description of the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory, a socio-technical environment to frame and solve wicked problems in urban planning."

We identify the anomalies based on the statistical models extracted from the recent observations of the file transfer events. This data-driven approach could be used in different use cases to identify unusual events. More specifically, we propose two different identification strategies based on the different properties of the observed file transfers. Because these methods capture key aspects of the two different segments of the data transfer pipeline, they are able to make accurate identifications for their respective workflow components. The current anomaly detection algorithms only make use of the file sizes as the primary feature. We anticipate that integrating more information will improve the prediction accuracy. Additional work is planned to validate the identification algorithms on more data and in different use cases."

With rapid prototyping and smaller production lot sizes, this results in frequent changes of assembly instructions that have to be memorized by workers. Assistive systems compensate this increase in mental workload by providing ""just-in-time"" assembly instructions through in-situ projections. The implementation of such systems and their benefits to reducing mental workload have previously been justified with self-perceived ratings. However, there is no evidence by objective measures if mental workload is reduced by in-situ assistance. In our work, we showcase electroencephalography (EEG) as a complementary evaluation tool to assess cognitive workload placed by two different assistive systems in an assembly task, namely paper instructions and in-situ projections.We identified the individual EEG bandwidth that varied with changes in working memory load. We show, that changes in the EEG bandwidth are found between paper instructions and in-situ projections, indicating that they reduce working memory compared to paper instructions. Our work contributes by demonstrating how design claims of cognitive demand can be validated. Moreover, it directly evaluates the use of assistive systems for delivering context-aware information. We analyze the characteristics of EEG as real-time assessment for cognitive workload to provide insights regarding the mental demand placed by assistive systems."

There were two dimensions for each survey: the safety criticality of the situation in which the system was being used and name-brand recognizability. We designed the surveys and administered them electronically, using Survey Monkey and Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We then performed statistical analyses of the survey results to discover common factors across the domains, domain-specific factors, and implications of safety criticality and brand recognizability on trust factors. We found commonalities as well as dissimilarities in factors between the two domains, suggesting the possibility of creating a core model of trust that could be modified for individual domains.

However, development of interrupt-driven systems is time-consuming and error-prone. To conveniently ensure a trustworthy system design and implementation is a challenging problem, especially in complex applications. In this paper, we present a novel domain-specific language called iDola to model interrupt-driven systems declaratively and concisely. A major strength of iDola is the feasibility to capture complex interrupt handling mechanism in real-time operating systems and target platforms, such as delayed service and buffered processing. We also propose the formal operational semantics and code generation algorithm of iDola, so that iDola models can be transformed to timed automata for verification and loaded to generate platform-specific codes. We apply iDola on the modeling of an industrial interrupt-driven system, multifunction vehicle bus controller which runs in an embedded environment with eCos operating system. Based on iDola, the system is modeled with a dispatcher which embodies advanced interrupt handling in eCos, including buffered interrupt service routine and deferred service routine. Through transformation, the system design is verified and design bugs are detected. Code generation is also executed using the proposed algorithm. Generated codes display comparatively equal performance in the real system. We believe iDola can facilitate building a trustworthy interrupt-driven system."

Compared to the standard Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs), the FANET architecture has some specific features (3D mobility, low UAV density, intermittent network connectivity) that bring challenges to the communication protocol design. Such routing protocol must provide safety by finding an accurate and reliable route between UAVs. This safety can be obtained through the use of agile method during software based routing protocol development (for instance the use of Model Driven Development) by mapping each FANET safety requirement into the routing design process. This process must be completed with a sequential safety validation testing with formal verification tools, standardized simulator (by using real simulation environment) and real-world experiments. In this paper, we considered FANET communication safety by presenting design methodologies and evaluations of FANET routing protocols. We use the LARISSA architecture to guarantee the efficiency and accuracy of the whole system. We also use the model driven development methodology to provide model and code consistency through the use of formal verification tools. To complete the FANET safety validation, OMNeT++ simulations (using real UAVs mobility traces) and real FANET outdoor experiments have been carried out. We confront both results to evaluate routing protocol performances and conclude about its safety consideration."

In addition to accurate inference for state estimation and anomaly tracking, illiad also exploits the underlying network structure of the CPS (wired or wireless) for state estimation purposes. We demonstrate the application of illiad to two diverse settings: a wireless sensor motes application and an IEEE 33-bus microgrid."
Image registration underwater for fluid flow measurements and mosaicking,"Eustice, R.; Singh, H.; Howland, J.",OCEANS 2000 MTS/IEEE Conference and Exhibition,2000,IEEE,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-0034481772,,"In this paper we present a unified framework of increasing complexity that handles image registration ranging from translation only motion between images, to a full eight parameter projective transformation.

To examine the role of translation only motion across images we look at video imagery from fluid flow across a flange at a hydrothermal vent site in Guaymas Basin in Mexico. We then show the extensions to this algorithm that are required to handle the case for 2D mosaicking, which involves translations, rotations, scale, and shear in an unstructured three dimensional underwater world. Finally, we show the effectiveness of these techniques on data acquired during photographic surveys of an ancient Roman shipwreck located in the Skerki Bank region in approx. 800m of water in the Mediterranean."
Imitation Learning: A Survey of Learning Methods,"Hussein, Ahmed;Gaber, Mohamed Medhat;Elyan, Eyad;Jayne, Chrisina",ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) 50.2 (2017),2017,ACM,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,re,ACM Computing Surveys,2018-03-31,10.1145/3054912,2-s2.0-85017424752,Deep learning | Feature representations | Imitation learning | Intelligent agents | Learning from demonstrations | Learning from experience | Reinforcement learning | Robotics | Self-improvement,"© 2017 ACM.Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions."

Our approach seamlessly integrates the image data recorded under nominal conditions with comprehensive statistical circuit models to synthetically generate the critical corner cases for which an autonomous driving system is likely to fail. As such, a given automotive system can be robustly validated for these worst-case scenarios that cannot be easily captured by physical experiments."

Technological companies are interested in traffic data for computing the best routes in a traffic-aware manner and they also provide real-time traffic information with certain temporal accuracy. This paper analyses and evaluates how data provided by a fleet of probe cars can be used to develop a navigation service and how the penetration rate of this service affects a set of city-scale KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and driver KPIs. The case study adopts a model-driven approach in which microscopic simulation emulates real-size fleets of probe vehicles that provide positions and speed data. What is noteworthy about the modelling behaviour is that drivers are segmented according to their knowledge of network conditions for selected trips: experts, regular drivers, and tourists. The paper presents and discusses the modelling approach and the results obtained from an experimental Barcelona CBD model designed to evaluate the penetration rates of probe vehicles and route guidance. An analysis of the simulation experiments reveals remarkable links among city-scale KPIs, which - from a multivariate point of view - is a novelty. A simulation-based framework for results analysis and visualization is also introduced in order to simplify the simulation results analysis and easily visualize OD paths for driver segments."

Indeterminacy arises in the model from the composition of aggregate output. In sharp contrast to the indeterminacy literature pioneered by Benhabib and Farmer [J. Benhabib, R. Farmer, Indeterminacy and increasing returns, J. Econ. Theory 63 (1) (1994) 19-41] and Gali [J. Gali, Monopolistic competition, business cycles, and the composition of aggregate demand, J. Econ. Theory 63 (1) (1994) 73-96], indeterminacy in our model is global; hence it is more robust to structural parameters. In addition, sunspots in our model can be autocorrelated. The paper provides a justification for exogenous variations in desired markups, which play an important role as a source of cost-push shocks in the monetary policy literature. Our model outperforms a standard RBC model driven by technology shocks in several dimensions, including the volatility of labor market and the hump-shaped output dynamics. © 2008."

However, they are still an underutilized technology. For coastal operations, the ability to track a certain feature is of interest to ocean scientists. Adaptive and predictive path planning requires frequent communication with significant data transfer. Currently, most AUVs rely on satellite phones as their primary communication. This communication protocol is expensive and slow. To reduce communication costs and provide adequate data transfer rates, we present the hardware and software components that make up a communication framework, which provides robust, disruption-tolerant, cost-effective glider operation for a coastal region. The framework is specifically designed to address multi-sensor deployments. We provide a system overview and present testing and coverage data for the network. Additionally, we include an application of ocean-model driven trajectory design, which can benefit from the use of this network and communication system. The presented combination of infrastructure, software development and deployment experience brings us closer to the goal of providing a reliable and cost-effective data transfer framework to enable real-time, optimal trajectory design, based on ocean model predictions, to gather in situ measurements of interesting and evolving ocean features and phenomena.

Typically, the underlying domain models are designed in an ad-hoc manner and the domain rules become hard-coded into the source-code of the application software. In this paper we describe an alternative and more flexible approach. The model is described in almost plain English using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and translated into target code via parser technology based on the ANTLR tool-chain. This provides more flexibility not only in creating and maintaining the domain rules, but also with regards to generating code for entirely different target languages and technology environments.

Actions performed in the context of a joint activity comprise two aspects: functional and communicative. The functional component achieves the goal of the action, whereas its communicative component, when present, expresses some information to the actor's partners in the joint activity. The interpretation of such communication requires leveraging information that is public to all participants, known as common ground. Much of human communication is performed through this implicit mechanism, and humans cannot help but infer some meaning - whether or not it was intended by the actor - from most actions. We present a framework for robots to utilize this communicative channel on top of normal functional actions to work more effectively with human partners. We consider the role of the actor and the observer, both individually and jointly, in implicit communication, as well as the effects of timing. We also show how the framework maps onto various modes of action, including natural language and motion. We consider these modes of action in various human-robot interaction domains, including social navigation and collaborative assembly."

For this scheme the measured stator current components are used as the reference model of the MRAS estimator to avoid the use of a pure integrator and reduce influence of motor parameter variation. The adaptive model of proposal estimator use a two-layer Neural Network (NN) to estimate the stator current, which requires the rotor flux information that can be obtained from the voltage model. A back-propagation learning algorithm is used to minimise the error in current estimation and hence in generating the estimated speed. Speed estimation performance of the proposal MRAS scheme is verified and compared with the classical rotor flux MRAS when applied to sensorless vector control SPIM drive. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed MRAS estimator for sensorless control of SPIM drive has good dynamic response, high precision in both the transient and steady modes, the performance of the SC_MRAS using NN is significantly improved especially at low and near zero speed range."

The Hawaii Mapping Research Group at the University of Hawaii was selected to supply a new data acquisition system consisting of both subsurface electronics and surface control/data logging computer. This new system performs all signal processing in the digital domain, using four Motorola 56309 digital signal processors to acquire signals from three port, three starboard and one subbottom transducer array. All seven transducer channels can be driven with arbitrary waveforms during transmit, allowing both conventional CW transmissions and coded pulses with FM, AM, and/or phase modulation. Center frequencies for quadrature detection are programmable, as is decimation filtering to match the transmitted waveforms. This will greatly improve the cross talk rejection over the previous system, which operated at the same frequency port and starboard. By acquiring data from the previously unused third sidescan transducer rows, bathymetric precision can be improved; the additional row also allows greater flexibility is transmit beam steering and shaping. The processors share a high-speed fiber optic telemetry link, manufactured by Prizm Inc., with other instruments carried in the DSL-120 tow vehicle.

Jinchun No.2), either self-grafted or grafted onto the rootstock 'Black Seeded' figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché) and 'Chaofeng Kangshengwang' (Lagenaria siceraria Standl.). Plants were grown in nutrient solutions with 1, 4 and 8 times the concentration of macronutrients in the base solution for 10 days, while the concentrations of micronutrients were the same, making the electrical conductivity (EC) value as 1.9, 5.7 and 9.8 dS m-1, respectively. The results showed that EC treatment significantly decreased scion (the part above graft union) dry weight, leaf relative water content, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and phosphorous (P) contents, but increased leaf electrical leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrogen (N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) contents of all grafted plants. However, compared with the self-grafted plants, cucumber plants grafted onto 'Black Seeded' figleaf gourd had higher scion dry weight not only under 1.9 dS m-1 treatment but also at 5.7 and 9.8 ones, and these plants could significantly alleviate scion growth reduction, maintain higher soluble sugar and manganese (Mn) contents, higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, but lower EL and MDA contents at 5.7 dS m-1.

However, object disambiguation can be a challenging task due to ambiguities in natural language. To reduce uncertainty when describing an object, humans often use a combination of unique object features and locative prepositions-prepositional phrases that describe where an object is located relative to other features (i.e., reference objects) in a scene. We present a new system for object disambiguation in cluttered environments based on probabilistic models of unique object features and spatial relationships. Our work extends prior models of spatial relationship semantics by collecting and encoding empirical data from a series of crowdsourced studies to better understand how and when people use locative prepositions, how reference objects are chosen, and how to model prepositional geometry in 3D space (e.g., capturing distinctions between “next to” and “beside”). Our approach also introduces new techniques for responding to compound locative phrases of arbitrary complexity and proposes a new metric for disambiguation confidence. An experimental validation revealed our method can improve object disambiguation accuracy and performance over past approaches."

The Digital Home Compliant (DHC) open communication protocol arises to meet that requirement by means of a software adapter for each device that acts as intermediary with the DHC network. Based on the fact that all the adapters have a high proportion of source code in common, this paper aims to go a step further in the use of the protocol automating the adapters’ process generation, following the Model Driven Architecture approach. The Web Services Java code is created from a template and a SysML model of the system, allowing the automatic deployment of the adapter and therefore, enhancing the global interoperability of the system.

The in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of the latex capped nanoparticles was carried out using human lung carcinoma cells (A549) by MTT cell viability assay. Further, possible cytotoxic mechanisms were evaluated using various biomarkers for cytotoxicity and oxidative stress viz. extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide generation and acridine orange/ethedium bromide staining. It can be concluded from the present study that LAgNP formulation is toxic to A549 cells in a dose dependent manner.

Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in human tissue, and a key index of antioxidant capacity and, hence, of oxidative stress. The aims of this investigation were to examine possible relationships between occipital GSH and dimensional measures of depressive symptom severity, including anhedonia - the reduced capacity to experience pleasure - and fatigue. We hypothesized that the magnitude of anhedonia and fatigue will be negatively correlated with occipital GSH levels in subjects with MDD and healthy controls (HC). Data for eleven adults with MDD and ten age- and sex-matched HC subjects were included in this secondary analysis of data from a previously published study. In vivo levels of GSH in a 3cm×3cm×2cm voxel of occipital cortex were obtained by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) on a 3T MR system, using the standard J-edited spin-echo difference technique. Anhedonia was assessed by combining interest items from depression and fatigue rating scales, and fatigue by use of the multidimensional fatigue inventory. Across the full sample of participants, anhedonia severity and occipital GSH levels were negatively correlated (r=-0.55, p=0.01). No associations were found between fatigue severity and GSH in this sample. These preliminary findings are potentially consistent with a pathophysiological role for GSH and oxidative stress in anhedonia and MDD. Larger studies in anhedonic depressed patients are indicated. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
In vivo hydroquinone exposure alters circulating neutrophil activities and impairs LPS-induced lung inflammation in mice,"Ribeiro, André Luiz Teroso;Shimada, Ana Lúcia Borges;Hebeda, Cristina Bichels;de Oliveira, Tiago Franco;de Melo Loureiro, Ana Paula;Filho, Walter dos Reis Pereira;Santos, Alcinéa Meigikos dos Anjos;de Lima, Wothan Tavares;Farsky, Sandra Helena Poliselli",Toxicology,2011,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Toxicology,2011-10-09,10.1016/j.tox.2011.05.009,2-s2.0-79961032694,Adhesion molecules | DNA fragmentation | Environmental contaminant | Mice | Oxidative burst,"Hydroquinone (HQ) is an environmental contaminant which causes immune toxicity. In this study, the effects of exposure to low doses of HQ on neutrophil mobilization into the LPS-inflamed lung were investigated. Male Swiss mice were exposed to aerosolized vehicle (control) or 12.5, 25 or 50ppm HQ (1h/day for 5 days). One hour later, oxidative burst, cell cycle, DNA fragmentation and adhesion molecules expressions in circulating neutrophils were determined by flow cytometry, and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured by HPLC. Also, 1h later the last exposures, inflammation was induced by LPS inhalation (0.1mg/ml/10min) and 3h later, the numbers of leukocytes in peripheral blood and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined using a Neubauer chamber and stained smears; adhesion molecules expressed on lung microvessel endothelial cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry; myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured in the lung tissue by colorimetric assay; and cytokines in the BALF were determined by ELISA. In vivo HQ exposure augmented plasma MDA levels and oxidative activity of neutrophils, but did not cause alterations in cell cycle and DNA fragmentation. Under these conditions, the number of circulating leukocytes was not altered, but HQ exposure reduced LPS-induced neutrophil migration into the alveolar space, as these cells remained in the lung tissue. The impaired neutrophil migration into BALF may not be dependent on reduced cytokines secretions in the BALF and lung endothelial adhesion molecules expressions. However, HQ exposure increased the expression of β2 and β3 integrins and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) in neutrophils, which were not further enhanced by fMLP in vitro stimulation, indicating that HQ exposure activates circulating neutrophils, impairing further stimulatory responses. Therefore, it has been shown, for the first time, that neutrophils are target of lower levels of in vivo HQ exposure, which may be considered in host defense in infectious diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Model-driven compensation is a realistic and efficient solution to solve this problem. However, a vital issue is the lack of reliable and easily obtainable patient-specific mechanical characteristics of the brain which, according to clinicians' experience, can vary considerably. We designed an aspiration device that is able to meet the very rigorous sterilization and handling process imposed during surgery, and especially neurosurgery. The device, which has no electronic component, is simple, light and can be considered as an ancillary instrument. The deformation of the aspirated tissue is imaged via a mirror using an external camera. This paper describes the experimental setup as well as its use during a specific neurosurgery. The experimental data was used to calibrate a continuous model. We show that we were able to extract an in vivo constitutive law of the brain elasticity: thus for the first time, measurements are carried out per-operatively on the patient, just before the resection of the brain parenchyma. This paper discloses the results of a difficult experiment and provide for the first time in vivo data on human brain elasticity. The results point out the softness as well as the highly non-linear behavior of the brain tissue. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We however advocate for a stronger focus on empowering individuals to self-track their own activities, emotions and performance at work, to reflect on the collected data and possibly use it to drive behavioral changes. In this paper, we focus in particular on empowering two specific categories of workers: teachers and students. We describe a pilot study that we ran at our institution to understand which data and data gathering tools can be used to monitor teachers' and students' emotions and engagement during lectures. We define an empirical metric, called the Emotional Shift, to assess the impact of a lecture on students emotional state. Using the data collected during our pilot study, we show how this metric can be used in practice. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our current approach and provide an outlook on our future work."

To tackle this issue, we have developed an affect detection system for identifying a driver's emotional arousal, including the driver's physiological data and vehicle's kinematic data. Multimodal sensors are wirelessly connected to a smartphone and then, all the driver and driving data are displayed on our Android application in real-time. With the benefits of this multimodal, portable, non-intrusive, and cost-efficient system, subsequent experiments were designed to test and improve the system. After identifying significant features, various machine learning algorithms will be used to model a driver's emotional states. Our final goal is to develop an optimized classifier of specific emotional states including arousal and valence. We hope that we can spark lively discussions on driver emotions at AutoUI and use the feedback to improve our system."

However, it has been underexplored whether such cooperation provides sufficient incentive to ISP and hosts under a setup where ISP and hosts are fully included, having a high dependence on how to cooperate and how to distribute the resulting cooperation worth. In this paper, we model a market of UPN, consisting of ISP, hosts, and clients via game theory, where we model various heterogeneities in terms of (i) willingness to pay and mobility pattern of clients, (ii) hosts' QoS, and (iii) type of cooperation among ISP and hosts. The key technical challenges lie in the natural mixture of cooperative and non-cooperative game theoretic angles, where the worth function-one of the crucial components in coalitional game theory-comes from the equilibrium of an embedded, non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game.We consider the Shapley value as a mechanism of revenue sharing and overcome its hardness in characterization by taking the fluid limit when the number of hosts and clients is large. Our analytical studies reveal useful implications that in UPN when and how much economic benefits can be given to the players and when they maintain their grand coalition under what conditions, referred to as stability."

Therefore, it is needed to deploy a high number of base stations in order to provide a requested quality of service. The advancement in technologies gives us an opportunity to use aerial base stations, which can change their positions in order to provide capacity only in space and time where and when it is needed. In this work, we present a novel self-organized approach based on gradient search and potential fields for aerial base station deployment in order to increase the cellular network capacity. In contrast to the current aerial base station deployment approaches, our solution satisfies all requirements of modern urban scenario - it uses only local information, adapts to different environments, provides high degree of autonomy and scalability and operates in real time. We provide a simulation-based evaluation of the proposed approach and a comparison to traditional base station placement in terms of the average aggregated system capacity. Results indicate that capacity can be improved by up to 52% in case of dense user clusters. Therefore network deployment costs can be minimized and spectrum efficiency maximized."

The storages are the standing ""stocks"", and the intra-system and boundary transfers are transactional ""flows"". Network environ analysis (NEA) provides network methods and perspectives for the quantitative analysis of compartment models. These emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect relationships between the compartments, and also with their environments. In NEA, each compartment in a system has an incoming network that brings energy or matter to it from the system's boundary inputs, and an outgoing network that takes substance from it to boundary outputs. These networks are, respectively, input and output environs. Individual pathways in environs have an identity not unlike spaghetti in a bowl, each strand of which originates at some boundary input and terminates at some boundary output. All strands originating at the j'th input collectively comprise, no matter where they terminate, the j'th output environ; similarly, all strands terminating at the i'th output comprise, no matter where they originate, the i'th input environ. Thus, any substance freely mixing in the system as a whole runs in pathways consigned to one and only one output environ traced forward from its compartment of entry, and also one and only one input environ traced backward from its compartment of exit. The environs are partition elements - they decompose the interior stocks and flow according to their input origins and output destinations. Moreover, each environ's dynamics and other systems and network properties are unique, and sum over all the environs to give the aggregate dynamics and properties of the whole. It is this composite, aggregate whole that empirical methods measure; empiricism unaided by theoretical analysis is blind to the environ pathways that actually compose the wholes.A previous study of nitrogen dynamics in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA (Whipple et al., 2007) described within-environ transfers using a throughflow-based network analysis, NEA-T. Throughflow (Tin, Tout) is the sum of flows into or out of each compartment. This paper extends this work using a companion storage-based methodology, NEA-S, re-notated from its antecedent and originating contributions (Barber, 1978a,b, 1979; Matis and Patten, 1981). Time-series data implementing 16 seasonal steady-state network models of nitrogen (N) storage and flow in the Neuse system were constructed for spring 1985 through winter 1989 by Christian and Thomas (2000, 2003). Network topology was constant over time, but the storage and transfer quantities changed. Environ analysis of this model showed that nitrogen storage and residence times differ within the different environs composing the compartments, and moreover, that these differences originate in the system's interconnecting network as a whole. Thus, environs function within themselves as autonomous flow-storage units, but this individuality derives from, and at the same time contributes to the entire system's properties. Environ autonomy is reflected in unique standing stocks and residence times, and whole empirical systems are formed as additive compositions of these. Because storage is durable and transfers ephemeral, storage environs revealed by NEA-S have more autonomy than flow environs computed using NEA-T. We quantified this autonomy by comparing the heterogeneity of extensive environs in models driven by actual inputs with intensive environs normalized to unit inputs. The former is more storage-heterogeneous than their unit reference counterparts, with dissolved nutrients NOx, DON, and NH4 exhibiting greatest heterogeneity. A previous NEA study of distributed control in this same model by Schramski et al. (2007) showed that NOx controls the system whereas sediment is controlled by the system. In the present study, NOx dominates storage in extensive environs, and therefore, is controlling in actuality. However, in the intensive unit, environs sediment accounted for most of the storage, reflecting greater control potential. This potential is expressed by the sediment acting like a capacitor for N, seasonally sequestering and releasing this element in the role of a biogeochemical regulator."

The study proposes to leverage autonomous mobility to reduce sensing infrastructure cost and enable real-time high-granularity monitoring that can be otherwise inhibitively laborious. Unique to the autonomous mobile sensing methodology, the collected IEQ samples are highly sparse in both spatial and temporal domains. The study develops spatio-temporal (ST) interpolation methods based on ST binning, global trend extraction, and local variation estimation, which efficiently use the data to construct accurate depiction of the indoor environment evolution. The method is evaluated by a standard protocol for ventilation assessment, where the estimation is shown to be highly correlated with the ground truth, and reveals the true ventilation conditions."

Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the driver intends to go to or learn about a specific point of interest along the vehicle's route, and an autonomous system is tasked with inferring this point of interest using gaze cues. Because the scene under observation is highly dynamic - both the background and objects in the scene move independently relative to the driver - such scenarios are significantly different from the static scenes considered by most literature in the eye tracking community. In this paper, we provide a formulation for this new problem of determining a point of interest in a dynamic scenario. We design an experimental framework to systematically evaluate initial solutions to this novel problem, and we propose our own solution called dynamic interest point detection (DIPD). We experimentally demonstrate the success of DIPD when compared to baseline nearest-neighbor or filtering approaches."

However, the contained information is also valuable for further development tasks. In this paper, we present an automated approach to extract information from these high-level activities. We put a focus on aspects of activities such as propositional logic relations, sequences of actions, and differentiability of execution paths. The extracted parts are needed for the compilation of requirements and the creation of test cases. Also, this approach supports stakeholders unfamiliar with the notations of activities as implicit information is made explicit and hence more accessible. For this purpose, we provide a formalism for the kind of activities our industry partner uses. Based on that formalism, we define properties that express the contained sequences and execution paths. Furthermore, the formalism is used to derive the underlying propositional logic relations.

We derive limits for the required number of sensor observations considering false alarms and miss detections, to declare the existence or absence of a target. the search environment is partitioned into equal-size cells, where each cell is associated with a probability of target existence and the number of visits by the UAVs, wich constitutes a probability map (search map) and a visit map (certainty map). We present a decentralized control model for cooperative target-searching and we develop a real-time approach for direct cooperation between vehicles, which is based on calculating the minimum time required to reach a cell. Each UAV takes into account the possible actions of other UAVs to increase the overall information about the environment. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by comparing it with the free moving strategy and show that our proposed algorithm performs out it."

All rights reserved.While much of the extant InfoSec research relies on single assessment models that predict intent to act, this article proposes a multi-stage InfoSec Process Action Model (IPAM) that can positively change individual InfoSec behavior. We believe that this model will allow InfoSec researchers to focus more directly on the process that leads to action and develop better interventions that address problematic security behaviors. Building on successful healthcare efforts that resulted in smoking cessation, regular exercise, and a healthier diet, among others, IPAM is a hybrid predictive process approach to behavioral InfoSec improvement. IPAM formulates the motivational antecedents of intent as separate from the volitional drivers of behavior. Singular fear appeals often seen in InfoSec research are replaced by more nuanced treatments appropriately differentiated to support behavioral change as part of a process; phase-appropriate measures of selfefficacy are employed to more precisely assess the likelihood that a participant will act on good intentions; and decisional balance - assessment of pro and con perceptions - is monitored over time. These notions better align InfoSec research with both leading security practice and successful comparators in healthcare. We believe IPAM can both help InfoSec research models better explain actual behavior and better inform practical security behavior improvement initiatives."

The MDXR features numerous improvements over the BXR, including: a cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer, an on-board absolute cryogenic radiometer (ACR), an internal blackbody reference, and an integrated collimator. The Cryo-FTS can be used to measure high resolution spectra from 4 to 20 micrometers, using a Si:As blocked-impurity-band (BIB) detector. The on-board ACR can be used for self-calibration of the MDXR BIB as well as for absolute measurements of infrared sources. A set of filter wheels and a rotating polarizer within the MDXR allow for filter-based and polarization-sensitive measurements. The optical design of the MDXR makes both radiance and irradiance measurements possible and enables calibration of both divergent and collimated sources. Details of the various MDXR components will be presented as well as initial testing data on their performance. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."

However, these tools keep lacking an explicit model representation of underlying resources making it difficult to introspect, verify or reconfigure the system in response to external events. In this paper, we outline a novel approach that treats system infrastructure as explicit runtime models. A key benefit of using such models@run.time representation is that it provides a uniform semantic foundation for resources monitoring and reconfiguration. Adopting models at runtime allows one to integrate different aspects of system management, such as resource monitoring and subsequent verification into an unified view which would otherwise have to be done manually and require to use different tools. It also simplifies the development of various self-adaptation strategies without requiring the engineers and researchers to cope with low-level system complexities."

This optimum is characterized by the minimality of the social cost function, i.e., the total cost of travel of all drivers. On the other hand, drivers are assumed to be rational and selfish, and make their travel decisions to optimize their own travel costs, bringing the state of the network to a user equilibrium (UE). In this paper, we model the behavior of users in the future connected vehicular transportation networks, where users consider both the travel cost and the utility from data communication when making their travel decisions. We divide the users into two groups based on the kind of data network they are using. We leverage the data communication aspect of the decision making to influence the user route choices, driving the UE state to the SO state. We propose a V2I bandwidth allocation scheme, which provides a guideline on how the system operator can adjust the parameters of the communication network to achieve the optimal UE."

However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method.

In this paper, and inspired from biological instinctive behaviour, we introduce an instinct-driven dynamic hardware reconfiguration design scheme using evolutionary algorithms on behaviour trees. Moreover, this scheme is projected on an application scenario of autonomous sensory agents exploring an inaccessible dynamic environment. In this scenario, agent's compression behaviour-introduced as an instinct-is critical due to the limited energy available on the agents. This emphasises the role of optimization of agents resources through dynamic hardware reconfiguration. In that regard, the presented approach is demonstrated using two compression techniques: Zeroorder hold and Wavelet compression. Behavioural and hardwarebased power models of these techniques, integrated with behaviour trees (BT), are implemented to facilitate off-line learning of the optimum on-line behaviour, thus, facilitating dynamic reconfiguration of agents hardware."

This study investigates modeling the hysteresis nonlinearities of these cables using a stop-operator based Prandtl-Ishlinskii (SPI) model that is integrated with a memoryless function. The stop-operator based model is employed to account for the hysteresis nonlinearities, while the memoryless function is introduced to characterize saturation and asymmetric effects. A numerical example is presented to compare the properties of the proposed model with the classic SPI model. The response of the suggested model was evaluated on the hysteresis properties of two different cables subjected to triangular harmonic input of 0 to 0.001 with 6.25 × 10-5 strain/s. The characterization error of the thick cable was found as 1.55 %, while the error was calculated as 1.25 % for the thin cable. The relative significance of the proposed model was further examined by comparing the measured data with the classic SPI model. The results showed that the classic model yields substantial characterization errors when the asymmetry and saturation effects of the strain-load hysteresis loops are ignored."

As these systems typically operate in a highly uncertain and dynamically changing environment, being able to cooperate and adapt in groups to cope with various (possibly unanticipated) situations becomes a crucial and challenging task. In this artifact, we respond to this challenge by presenting the Intelligent Ensembles framework, consisting of a high-level declarative language for describing dynamic cooperation groups, and a Java runtime library for automatically forming groups that best satisfy the given specification. The framework provides dynamic architecture adaptation (i.e., forming groups of components and exchanging data between them) based on the state of components and situation in their environment. Further, the framework can be used as a first step of a group-wise adaptation (i.e., identifying components that are to negotiate and coordinate in an adaptation). The framework is built on top of the Z3 SMT solver and the Eclipse Modelling Framework."

This, in turn, has led to the need for hospital-wide management and integration of information, and has triggered major efforts towards the development of integrated hospital information systems. A framework for developing an integrated regional health telematics system is presented, based on the functional and data integration of federated autonomous information systems. The concept of the patient meta-record is introduced as a central element in achieving integration in terms of content, structure, and access to information resources. Intelligent image management at the level of either a single health care provider (hospital) or a regional health telematics network is addressed and is achieved through event and model-driven strategies enabled by a distributed hierarchical storage management system. Intelligence, in this context, refers to methods of efficient and effective real-time resource management in the timely delivery of health care."

This paper proposes an intelligent shape representation and recognition system that can handle a large class of objects under less constrained situations. The investigation treats intelligent integration of different shape representation schemes and generation of the best shape recognition strategy using global shape properties. The proposed scheme effectively incorporates model-driven top-down and data-driven bottom-up approaches of shape analysis. By analyzing global shape properties, the essential features and their degrees of importance are determined quickly. In the representation phase, objects are described by using these essential features; in the recognition phase, searching for the best candidate is restricted to the models represented by these features and the observed shape is matched to the candidate models in the order of importance of the essential features. Systems are being developed for two-and threedimensional shapes separately since they are exploiting different visual data—photometric and range, respectively. © 1988 IEEE"

Modern self-adaptive and self-organizing systems usually must achieve several functional goals. Each can be achieved through alternative realization strategies (i.e. choices) and supported by the decision process of one agent or subsystem. The above is an example, among many others, that implies considering a system shaped by several agents interacting among themselves in a decentralized way towards a higher level goal. The multiple interacting agents involve diverse perspectives with effects on different common software qualities (also known as non-functional requirements or soft goals) and the agents will collaborate or compete among themselves. An example of a potential problem could be that one decision suggested by an agent may cancel out the positive effects of another agent on a given software quality with potentially unwanted results. The agents can also use machine learning techniques which exacerbates the uncertainty implied and its effect on the interactions among agents over time. We argue that there is the need for coordinating the decision-making process by different agent-based models in an explicit and decentralized way and that models@run.time can be a means for this. The runtime coordination gives place to big challenges. In this paper, and based on an initial exploration of the state-of-the-art, we discuss ideas about how to engineer modern self-adaptive and self-organizing systems. We propose a taxonomy to ease the engineering of such systems and based on that, we discuss the role of models@run.time to support the models of expected behaviour in an explicit way."

There is a considerable body of work in this area including efforts to make serious games, virtual reality and robotic applications. While innovative technologies have been introduced over the years, and often researchers produce promising experimental results, these technologies have not yet delivered the anticipated benefits. The causes for this apparent failure are evident when looking a closer look at the case of stroke rehabilitation, which is one of the heaviest researched topics for developing rehabilitation technologies. It is argued that improvements should be sought by centering the design on an understanding of patient needs, allowing patients, therapists and care givers in general to personalize solutions to the need of patients, effective feedback and motivation strategies to be implemented, and an in depth understanding of the socio-Technical system in which the rehabilitation technology will be embedded. These are classic challenges that human computer interaction (HCI) researchers have been dealing with for years, which is why the field of rehabilitation technology requires considerable input from HCI researchers, and which explains the growing number of relevant HCI publications pertaining to rehabilitation.

It involves each appropriate discipline and follows a structured process which guides the team through the early phases of the product life-cycle. Furthermore, integrated design models and domain specific tools support the engineers in generating and exchanging design parameters. As is often misunderstood, Concurrent Engineering is not a design optimization performed by advanced software, but is a team effort where the product development is supported by tools but decisions still made by people. During feasibility studies of space craft design within the Concurrent Engineering Facility (CEF) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) there is a certain set-up of domains each dealing with their respective hard- and software tools. Within the present paper the cases of human-to-human and human-to-machine interaction during the iterative design process is discussed. The focus is set on the interaction between and within the different parties during both the plenary and off-line design sessions. The importance of guided communication and the value of specific and common tool utilization is pointed out. Furthermore, the challenges, constraints, potential improvements and stumbling blocks are identified when dealing with a heterogeneous team of experts in such early design phases. © 2011 IEEE."

Our design process is inspired by muscular hydrostat structures, which drive highly versatile motions in many biological systems. We begin by instrumenting simulated plush toys with a large number of small, independently-actuated, virtual muscle-fibers. Through an intuitive posing interface, users then begin animating their plushie. A novel numerical solver, reminiscent of inverse-kinematics, computes optimal contractions for each muscle-fiber such that the soft body of the plushie deforms to best match user input. By analyzing the co-activation patterns of the fibers that contribute most to the plushie's motions, our design system generates physically-realizable winch-tendon networks. Winch-tendon networks model the motorized cable-driven actuation mechanisms that drive the motions of our real-life plush toy prototypes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our computational approach by co-designing motions and actuation systems for a variety of physically-simulated and fabricated plushies."

We characterize the domain-independent challenges posed by this problem, and describe how properties of domains influence the challenges and their solutions. We will concentrate on dynamic, data-rich domains where humans are ultimately responsible for team behavior. Thus, the automated aid should interactively support effective and timely decision making by the human. We present a domain-independent categorization of the types of alerts a plan-based monitoring system might issue to a user, where each type generally requires different monitoring techniques. We describe a monitoring framework for integrating many domain-specific and task-specific monitoring techniques and then using the concept of value of an alert to avoid operator overload. We use this framework to describe an execution monitoring approach we have used to implement Execution Assistants (EAs) in two different dynamic, data-rich, real-world domains to assist a human in monitoring team behavior. One domain (Army small unit operations) has hundreds of mobile, geographically distributed agents, a combination of humans, robots, and vehicles. The other domain (teams of unmanned ground and air vehicles) has a handful of cooperating robots. Both domains involve unpredictable adversaries in the vicinity. Our approach customizes monitoring behavior for each specific task, plan, and situation, as well as for user preferences. Our EAs alert the human controller when reported events threaten plan execution or physically threaten team members. Alerts were generated in a timely manner without inundating the user with too many alerts (less than 10% of alerts are unwanted, as judged by domain experts). © 2003 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

In this paper, we present a new interactive segmentation method based on the Image Foresting Transform (IFT). The method over segments the input image, creates a graph based on these segments (super pixels), receives markers (labels) drawn by the user on some super pixels and organizes a competition to label every pixel in the image. Our method has several interesting properties: it is effective, efficient, capable of segmenting multiple objects in almost linear time on the number of super pixels, readily extendable through previously published techniques, and benefits from domain-specific feature extraction. We also present a comparison with another technique based on the IFT, which can be seen as its pixel-based counterpart. Another contribution of this paper is the description of automatic (robot) users. Given a ground truth image, these robots simulate interactive segmentation by trained and untrained users, reducing the costs and biases involved in comparing segmentation techniques. © 2013 IEEE."

Safety assurance cases (SAC) provide a state-of-The-Art solution for reasoning about system and software safety in numerous safety-critical domains. We propose a novel approach based on the idea of interlocking safety cases. The sUAS infrastructure safety case (iSAC) specifies assumptions and applies constraints upon the behavior of sUAS entering the airspace. Each sUAS then demonstrates compliance to the iSAC by presenting its own (partial) safety case (uSAC) which connects to the iSAC through a set of interlock points. To enforce a ""trust but verify"" policy, sUAS conformance is monitored at runtime while it is in the airspace and its behavior is described using a reputation model based on the iSAC's expectations of its behavior."

Properties of such systems include variety, emergent outcome, self-organisation, etc. The scale of IoT systems, and the disparity in the capabilities of the devices on the market, means there needs to be a unifying model to enable a secure and assured interaction among those ""things. The authors propose conceptual designs for an efficient architecture, run-time decision models using assured models for such an interaction in a digital eco-system. This is done using the situation calculus modelling to represent the fundamental requirements for adjustable decentralised feedback control mechanisms necessary for the IoT-ready software systems: It is shown that complex properties and emergent outcomes of the system can be deduced, emanating from the simple distributed interaction models. A case study from the rail industry is used to assess the design and possible implementation."
Internet-based patient education intervention for fibromyalgia: A model-driven evaluation,"Camerini L., Frisch A.-L., Schulz P.J.",AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report,2011,Scopus,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-80051487169,,"Patients suffering from chronic diseases constantly face the need to learn how to self-manage their health condition and often turn to the Internet to seek help and support from health professionals and laypeople. Internet-based interventions can be an effective tool for patients' education and have been shown to positively impact patients' health outcomes. Focusing on the process leading from Internet usage to health outcomes, this paper reports a model-driven evaluation of a specific Internet-based intervention for patients affected by fibromyalgia syndrome. The evaluation is based on a cross-sectional survey of 209 fibromyalgia patients who were involved in the Internet intervention. Analyses were conducted using a structural equation modeling approach. The analysis mostly confirms the assumed theoretical model with minor and theoretically sound modifications. Results show that the usage of certain tools of the application impacts patients' health knowledge, which in turn impacts self-management. Improvements in self-management ultimately lower the impact of fibromyalgia syndrome. These results are discussed, alongside major implications for the evaluation of Internet-based interventions.

Internet-Based Self-Services: From Analysis and Design to Deployment,"Cardoso, Jorge;Miller, John A.","Services Economics (SE), 2012 IEEE First International Conference on",2012,IEEE,0,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,"Proceedings - 2012 IEEE 1st International Conference on Services Economics, SE 2012",2012-10-01,10.1109/SE.2012.8,2-s2.0-84866659574,EA | MDD | MVC | PaaS | Self-services | Service architecture | Service design | Service engineering,"Many worldwide economies have moved away from manufacturing and became service-oriented. As a consequence, research on Internet-based Self-Services (ISS) will foster the uptake of service exports and trading since they can replace many face-to-face interactions and make service transactions more accurate, convenient and faster. Currently, ISS are poorly supported since they are created using generic software techniques and development methods. Systematic methods are needed and must go beyond service design, a well established research area, to account also for service analysis, implementation, and deployment. In this paper, we explore a systematic development approach, called SEASIDE, based on four scientific advances: enterprise architectures (EA), model-driven developments (MDD), model-view-controller pattern (MVC), and platform as a service (PaaS). By selecting the Incident Management service from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, we have evaluated our approach. Our research indicates that the proposed method enables to focus on the business and design side of services, and reduce development time and costs. © 2012 IEEE."
Introducing a harmonized and generic cross-platform interface between a Vehicle and the Cloud,"Wagner, Marco;Laverman, Jeroen;Grewe, Dennis;Schildt, Sebastian","2016 IEEE 17th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)",2016,IEEE,0,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,"WoWMoM 2016 - 17th International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks",2016-07-26,10.1109/WoWMoM.2016.7523575,2-s2.0-84983739544,,"© 2016 IEEE.Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity is opening up a vehicle's internal data and function portfolio to the outside world. This sets up new chances by being able to create new customer services that enable new business models and opportunities. However, current approaches for Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity tend to build technological silos by being restricted to a single manufacturer or model, a single functionality or to the automotive domain which excludes seamless connectivity to other domains such as IoT or IT. Hence, a harmonized and generic cross-platform interface, a so called Vehicle Abstraction Layer, between the vehicle and the cloud has to be developed. A key issue within this task is the design of an abstract description of data and functionality provided by a vehicle. Such a description allows to automatically generate code in order to bind any vehicle being described to a cloud system. This paper introduces such an abstract description by using Eclipse Vorto, an open source device description framework. It also presents the technology used as well as a description scheme. Furthermore, the approach is illustrated by an example scenario."

This paper presents an approach that considers traceability of safety requirements in the context of model-driven development of teleoperated services robots. The combination of the model-driven approach with safety requirements traceability makes it possible to construct systems using techniques for automatically identifying, managing, and mitigating risks so that these systems are safe enough to work in a particular environment. To secure the advantages of these mechanisms, we have developed a tool that provides users with traceability reports after applying model transformations. These reports enable developers to determine whether or not all safety requirements have been considered, the impact of changing a safety requirement, and how they are considered both in architectural decisions and code implementations. © 2011 IEEE."
Introduction to Parallel DEVS Modelling and Simulation,Yentl Van Tendeloo and Hans Vangheluwe,Mod4Sim '18,2018,ACM,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-85055352517,,"© 2018 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).DEVS is a popular formalism for modelling complex dynamic systems using a discrete-event abstraction. Main advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for modularity: models can be hierarchically nested. Thanks to these properties, DEVS frequently serves as a simulation “assembly language” to which models in other formalisms are mapped. This makes it possible to combine models in different formalisms together by mapping both to DEVS. This tutorial introduces the practical use of the Parallel DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion. We start from simple autonomous Atomic (i.e., nonhierarchical) DEVS models and increment up to Coupled (i.e., hierarchical) DEVS models. Each increment is illustrated with a minimal running example. The focus is on the practical use of DEVS modelling and simulation, though necessary theoretical foundations are interleaved. Examples are presented using Python- PDEVS, though the foundations and techniques apply to other DEVS simulation tools as well."
Investigating a two-way-audio query-response command interface with navigation data extraction for driver assistance,"Loui, Ronald P.;Kharpate, Vishakha;Deshpande, Mitali;Alanazi, Fatmah",2017 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT),2017,IEEE,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology,2017-09-27,10.1109/EIT.2017.8053337,2-s2.0-85033728891,,"© 2017 IEEE.Navigation systems for drivers tend to vocalize what they want, when they want. Drivers who need to clarify instructions are often required to read directions in text form, which is a safety risk during real-time control. Instead, we investigate how a two-way-audio command interface might work. Data is easily extracted from text directions so that questions can be answered without knowledge of the GPS location, as long as the system is aware of the most recently vocalized directional cue (and elapsed time since last utterance). Functions envisioned are as simple as scrolling forward or back through the directions, spelling names or pronouncing differently, repeating the road name or directional change, and saying what is next on command. The queries require modest data extraction with potentially great improvement in usability. Queries may further refer to time and the results of some intermittent internet search, but do not attempt to interpret 2d map data. This project is ongoing, and the contribution includes a novel design architecture that puts a second AI assistant in the co-pilot's seat. This design provides domain-specific memory and vocalization assistance on top of the navigational assistance already familiar to the driver: voice AI (vAI) for improved voice UI (vUI). It aims more for a smart TiVo than co-pilot Siri. When navigation assistance and two-way audio dialogue are provided by the same vendor, the audio recognition and current location errors can be significantly reduced, but the current design is intended as a third-party intervention, adding assistance where the original product is lacking and possibly creating pressure for their products to improve."

This raises a gap between modeling and programming which requires developers to switch between both activities and their contexts. Action languages that enable interacting with GPL artifacts on model level can alleviate the need for switching, but cannot rely on the mature development tools of GPLs. We propose to investigate the acceptance and effects of MDE with action languages that GPL interaction. To this effect, we present a study design for comparing MDE with integration of handcrafted artifacts to pervasive MDE with action languages. In this study, participants develop the behavior of selected components of the software architecture of a small autonomous robot using either the delegation pattern or a Java-like action language. With this, we aim to uncover which method yields better acceptance and performance results."

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in cerebral hypoperfusion-induced dementia and cholinergic dysfunction. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CHP) was induced by permanent bilateral common carotid artery (2VO) occlusion in rats. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion resulted in anterograde memory impairment revealed from Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance step through tasks (PA), which was significantly attenuated by ACE inhibitor, captopril. Cerebral hypoperfusion down-regulated the relative expression of cholinergic muscarinic receptor (ChM-1r) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) as well as up-regulated the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT-1) expression in hippocampus of vehicle treated CHP group on the 54th day post-hypoperfusion. The diminished number of presynaptic cholinergic neurons and the pyramidal neurons were evident from ChAT-immunofluorescence and the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining studies respectively in hippocampal Cornu ammonis1 (CA1); region of vehicle-treated hypoperfused animals. Further the lipid peroxidation level was also found to be elevated in the hippocampus of the vehicle-treated group. Our results demonstrated that continuous captopril treatment (50 mg/kg, i.p. twice daily) for 15 days mitigated the hypoperfusion-induced cholinergic hypofunction and neurodegeneration in hippocampus. The present study robustly reveals that the angiotensinergic system plays a pivotal role in progression of neuronal death and memory dysfunctions during cerebral hypoperfusion. © 2008 IBRO."

Iron-Dependent Self-Assembly of Recombinant Yeast Frataxin: Implications for Friedreich Ataxia,"Adamec, Jiri;Rusnak, Frank;Owen, Whyte G.;Naylor, Stephen;Benson, Linda M.;Gacy, A.

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA. These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals. The functional mechanism of frataxin, however, is still unknown. We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p (mYfh1p) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro. Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer (13,783 Da) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of ˜1.1 MDa (megadaltons) and a diameter of 13 ± 2 nm. Each multimer consists of ˜60 subunits and can sequester >3,000 atoms of iron. Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly. Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer, indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight >600,000. After addition of 55Fe to the medium, immunoprecipitates of this species contain >16 atoms of 55Fe per molecule of mYfh1p. We propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant mYfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability."

Ischemic conditioning protects the rat retina in an experimental model of early type 2 diabetes,"Salido, Ezequiel M.;Dorfman, Damián;Bordone, Melina;Chianelli, Mónica S.;Sarmiento, María Inés Keller;Aranda, Marcos;Rosenstein, Ruth E.",Experimental Neurology,2013,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Experimental Neurology,2013-02-01,10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.11.006,2-s2.0-84870874089,Diabetic retinopathy | Experimental type 2 diabetes mellitus | Ischemic conditioning,"Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of acquired blindness in adults, mostly affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have developed an experimental model of early T2DM in adult rats which mimics some features of human T2DM at its initial stages, and provokes significant retinal alterations. We investigated the effect of ischemic conditioning on retinal changes induced by the moderate metabolic derangement. For this purpose, adult male Wistar rats received a control diet or 30% sucrose in the drinking water, and 3. weeks after this treatment, animals were injected with vehicle or streptozotocin (STZ, 25. mg/kg). Retinal ischemia was induced by increasing intraocular pressure to 120. mmHg for 5. min; this maneuver started 3. weeks after vehicle or STZ injection and was weekly repeated in one eye, while control eyes were submitted to a sham procedure. Fasting and postprandial glycemia, and glucose, and insulin tolerance tests were analyzed. At 12. weeks of treatment, animals which received a sucrose-enriched diet and STZ showed significant differences in metabolic tests, as compared with control groups. Brief ischemia pulses in one eye and a sham procedure in the contralateral eye did not affect glucose metabolism in control or diabetic rats. Ischemic pulses reduced the decrease in the electroretinogram a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potential amplitude, and the increase in retinal lipid peroxidation, NOS activity, TNFα, Müller cells glial fibrillary acidic protein, and vascular endothelial growth factor levels observed in diabetic animals. In addition, ischemic conditioning prevented the decrease in retinal catalase activity induced by T2DM. These results indicate that induction of ischemic tolerance could constitute a fertile avenue for the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat diabetic retinopathy associated with T2DM. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

Previous work demonstrated that in simulated vehicles with wing membrane damage, in-flight recovery of effective vehicle attitude and vehicle position control precision via use of an in-flight adaptive learning oscillator was possible. A significant portion of the most recent approaches to this problem employed an island-of-fitness compact genetic algorithm (ICGA) for oscillator learning. The work presented in this paper provides the details of a domain specific search space reduction approach implemented with existing ICGA and its effect on the in-flight learning time. Further, it will be demonstrated that the proposed search space reduction methodology is effective in producing an error correcting oscillator configuration rapidly, online, while the vehicle is in normal service. The paper will present specific simulation results demonstrating the value of the search space reduction and discussion of future applications of the technique to this problem domain."

We present a model which makes this possible for robots with limited communication channels beyond the execution of task actions themselves. We implement our model in a pick-and-place robot, and experiment with two strategies for grounding uncertainty. In an observer study, we show that participants observing interactions with the robot run by the two different strategies were able to infer the degree of understanding the robot had internally, and in the more uncertainty-expressive system, were also able to perceive the degree of internal uncertainty the robot had reliably."

Current strategies, such as one-on-one therapy done in rehabilitation centers, have limitations such as treatment frequency and intensity, cost and requirement of mobility. Thus, a promising strategy is home-based therapy that includes task specific exercises. However, traditional rehabilitation tasks may frustrate the patient due to their repetitive nature and may result in lack of motivation and poor rehabilitation. In this article, we propose the design and verification of an effective upper extremity rehabilitation game with a tangible robotic platform named Cellulo as a novel solution to these issues. We first describe the process of determining the design rationales to tune speed, accuracy and challenge. Then we detail our iterative participatory design process and test sessions conducted with the help of stroke, brachial plexus and cerebral palsy patients (18 in total) and 7 therapists in 4 different therapy centers.

The charging demand necessary for EVs transportation is performed using a vehicle decision model based on travel patterns. Several alternatives are available for the installation of EVCS, feeders, transformers and wind power generators. Consequently, the optimal expansion plan selects the best alternative and location for the candidate assets considering uncertainty associated to demand, wind speed and EV charging demand. The uncertainty is characterized through a set of scenarios that explicitly capture the correlation between the uncertain sources. The problem is defined as a stochastic-programming-based model driven by the minimization of the annualized investment, maintenance, production, losses and non-supplied energy costs. The resulting associated scenario-based deterministic is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for which infinite convergence to optimality is guaranteed. A 24-bus system case study is provided illustrating the results of the proposed approach."

Compared to the standard Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs), the UAANET architecture has some specific features that brings exciting challenges to communication architecture design. One of them is the design challenge of a UAANET routing protocols. It must find an accurate and reliable route between nodes in a timely manner to exchange data traffics. It must also be secured to preserve efficiency in the presence of malicious attackers and provides data integrity and authentication. Furthermore, UAANETs must be certified in the near future to act as autonomous systems without a dedicated safety pilot and to be authorized to fly in the national airspace. In such a context, in this paper, we contribute to the certification of the secure UAANET communication system software using a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach and real experiments based validation. The validation process followed uses sequentially formal verification methods and real-world experimental results. The objective is to evaluate the routing protocol efficiency to a set of unexpected hazardous issues that come with the real environment."

JTorX improves over its predecessor TorX [14] by using uioco and this newer ioco theory. By being much easier to deploy, due to improved installation, configuration and usage. And by integrating additional functionality, next to testing: checking for (u)ioco between models [6]; checking for underspecified traces in a model; interactive or guided simulation of a model.

Among them, Model-driven Engineering (MDE) has emerged as a concrete alternative to automatically generate Android applications. However, the current MDE propositions generate only part of the application, forcing developers to spend time in implementation tasks. To tackle that, we propose JustModeling, an MDE approach formed by JBModel, a graphical modeling tool with which the user models the application business classes using the UML class diagram and that provides a set of model transformations to generate code for the JustBusiness framework, which automatically generates all necessary resources of the mobile application. This allows developers to work on a higher level of abstraction, focusing on the application design rather than implementation issues. The approach was validated by a case study that showed better results than JustBusiness and the traditional development."

The attitudes towards learning to program were recorded using the self-reporting questionnaires and the behaviour was captured using the eye-trackers. The results show that the gaze-behaviour of the children moderates the relationship among the different attitudes towards coding.

However, the current implementation of ns-3 does not provide specific models suitable for AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) mobility. An old proposal is available, made by Andrea Sacco during his Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2010 project. However, the code has never been integrated into ns-3. In order to simulate the communications of AUVs, it is mandatory to rely also on simple and effective mobility systems, where the kinematic constraints of the node are taken into account. The requirements of a mobility model for AUVs is to be able to take into account the kinematic model of the real device and to set up a feasible path between two (or more) points.

In particular, for two complementary welding processes, namely, the Self-Shielded Flux-Cored and the Submerged-Arc processes. The paper reviews the phases of a 6-year project and concludes that qualitative reasoning holds out the most potential for combining knowledge from related domains. It is also suggested that conventional approaches to so-called knowledge advancement in a scientific sense may ultimately result in domain-specific information and knowledge that is its own barrier to more general usefulness. With hindsight it would seem that the lessons to be drawn from this project are more to do with misconceptions and misunderstandings about expert systems and the nature of knowledge itself, and about the danger of underestimating the complexity of a domain, more so when it has already been a research topic for a considerable period of time. The discussion is purposely software independent because it is the authors' view that whilst the software and knowledge representation formalisms have a bearing on the ease of solution of the problem, they are comparatively secondary issues. The key driving force for this project has been the advancement of knowledge about the welding domain itself. It would appear that expert systems techniques are not only a suitable approach to the solution of this problem, but that they are also a catalyst for the rigorous and logical scrutiny of the domain knowledge, its gaps, and its inconsistencies. Therefore there is as much to be gained from the process of building an expert system as there is from the final product. © 1994."

We generate a population of viruses in addition to a population of routes. Crossover and infection determine the optimal combination of viruses. When traffic congestion changes during driving, an alternative route can be generated using viruses and other routes in the population in the shortest time.

Organizational culture, informal roles, and individual attitudes interact to influence organizational processes such as knowledge sharing, a process vital to organizational performance and innovation. To explore such organizational dynamics, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates dynamic social networks over the physical environment of a hospital in southwest Virginia. The ABM simulates attitude formation and knowledge spread within the hospital.

As the evaluation of mostly conflicting objective functions requires computational expensive numerical field simulations, a fast converging optimization algorithm which depends on only a few exact evaluations is needed. Instead of running exact calculations on every design the objective values are estimated by means of a Kriging model in advance and only the most promising design candidates are being computed in a more accurate way. Furthermore, good solutions are searched for directly on the metamodel and particles are spawned at the corresponding positions in the parameter space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated with the help of an analytical test case and used for design optimization of a 10 poles PMSM with 11 parameters and 3 objectives. © 2013 IEEE."

However, elaborating requirements for feedback loop activities for the specific case of runtime models is rather neglected. Therefore, we investigate requirements for Adaptation Models that specify the analysis, decision-making, and planning of adaptation as part of a feedback loop. In particular, we consider requirements for a modeling language of adaptation models, and for a framework as the execution environment of adaptation models. Moreover, we discuss patterns for using adaptation models within the feedback loop regarding the structuring of loop activities. The patterns and the requirements for adaptation models inuence each other, which impacts the design of the feedback loop. 1 Introduction Self-adaptation capabilities are often required for modern software systems."

The natural architectural structure of component-based systems calls for hierarchy and modularity in the design and implementation of composites and their managers, and requires support for coordinated multiple autonomic loops.In this paper, we leverage the modularity capability to strengthen the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Ctrl-F, targeted at the design of autonomic managers in component-based systems. Its original definition involved discrete control-theoretical management of reconfigurations, providing assur-ances on the automated behaviors. The objective of modularity is two-fold: from the design perspective, it allows designers to seamlessly decompose a complex system into smaller pieces of reusable architectural elements and adaptive behaviours. From the compilation point of view, we provide a systematical and generative approach to decompose control problems described in the architectural level while relying on mechanisms of modular Discrete Control Synthesis (DCS), which allows us to cope with the combinatorial complexity that is inherent to DCS problems.

Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method is favored for several attractive properties. Specifically, it does not require tuning of learning rate carefully, shuffling the training set at each iteration, or storing massive redundant variables, and can introduce new agents into the computations on the fly.

Over the years, AEDC has continuously responded to the lethality test and evaluation requirements of Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) at hypervelocity intercept conditions. Projectiles launched from two-stage light-gas guns experience acceleration loads that are typically orders of magnitude greater than those of the actual missile defense system. These acceleration loads drive design compromises in the projectiles' geometry and mass-density distribution necessary to survive the launch environment. A ""high-fidelity"" projectile with the proper geometry and mass-density distribution would provide a more representative simulation of the flight vehicle kinetic energy release at impact. Prior to the current upgrades, the range G facility provided the capability to launch large projectiles [8-in. (203-mm) diameter] with weights up to 12 kg at launch velocities up to 4 km/s but at acceleration loads near 40 K g's. Current upgrades provide for the capability to launch large-scale ""higher fidelity"" projectiles at the same high velocities but at half the g loads. In addition, AEDC is developing a new technique for controlling the projectile pitch at the point of impact with a simulated target. These unique capabilities will make it possible to obtain more flight-representative lethality data in a ballistic range. This paper describes the upgraded capabilities now in place and continuing plans for further upgrades."

The availability of additive manufacturing (AM) technology has relaxed the fabricating limitation of lattice structures. However, manufacturing constraints still exist for AM-fabricated lattice structures, which have a significant influence on the printing quality and mechanical properties of lattice struts. In this paper, a design and optimization strategy is proposed for lattice structures with the consideration of manufacturability to ensure desired printing quality. The concept of manufacturable element is used to link the design and manufacturing process. A meta-model is constructed by experiments and the artificial neural network to obtain the manufacturing constraints. Sizes of struts are optimized by a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization-based algorithm with these manufacturing constraints. An arm of quadcopter is redesigned and optimized to validate the proposed method. Its result shows that optimized heterogeneous lattice structures can improve the stiffness of the model compared to the homogeneous lattice structure and the original design. Both the Von-Mises stress and the maximum displacement are reduced without increasing the weight of designed part. And by considering the manufacturability constraints, the optimized design has been successfully fabricated by the selected additive manufacturing process. Note to Practitioners - Lattice structures might fail to be fabricated by the additive manufacturing technique if the designed model exceeds the processability of the machine. Our approach has the capability of considering the manufacturing constraints in the design and optimization process. We conducted experiments to investigate the manufacturability and proposed a method that can give the domain of the design variables for a selected manufacturing process. And we also designed an algorithm that can optimize the lattice structure inside the domain of design variables. It ensures that the lattice model can be successfully fabricated by the selected process and the performance is dramatically increased compared to the original design. Engineers can use our approach to optimize the lattice structure automatically without knowing the knowledge of optimization and manufacturability."

Adult male mice were randomly divided into two groups (18 animals/group): a vehicle group [500ppm (mg/L) CH3COONa/day for 4weeks in their drinking water] and a Pb-treated group [500ppm Pb(CH3COO)2/day for 4weeks in their drinking water]. At the end of the treatment period, mice were subjected to the behavioral tasks. Learning/memory was tested by step-through passive avoidance test, whereas fear/anxiety was studied using the elevated plus-maze and thigmotaxis tests. Pb levels in mice brain were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. AChE activity was determined colorimetrically, and GSH and MDA levels fluorometrically in whole brain minus cerebellum, cerebral cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. The possible correlations between learning/memory or fear/anxiety behavior with the AChE activity and/or the lipid peroxidation levels and GSH content were also examined. Pb consumption caused significant deficits on mice learning/memory ability and increased anxiety. The consumption of the Pb solution inhibited the activity of the two AChE isoforms in all brain regions tested. Moreover, Pb exposure increased lipid peroxidation and decreased GSH levels in all brain regions examined. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the coefficients between the particular behaviors, AChE activity and redox balance were brain region- and AChE isoform-specific. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

The model is strongly data driven and provides an anomaly detector for robotics systems both applicable in-situ at runtime as well as a-posteriori in post-mortem analysis. Current architectures or methods for failure detection in autonomous robots are either implementations of watch dog concepts or are based on excessive amounts of domain-specific error detection code. The approach presented in this contribution provides an avenue for the detection of more subtle anomalies originating from external sources such as the environment itself or system failures such as resource starvation. Additionally, developers are alleviated from explicitly modeling and foreseeing every exceptional situation, instead training the presented probabilistic model with the known normal modes within the specification of the robot system. As we developed and evaluated the self-awareness model on a mobile robot platform featuring an event-driven software architecture, the presented method can easily be applied in other current robotics software architectures. ©2010 IEEE."

There are multiple fronts to these endeavors, including object detection on roads, 3-D reconstruction etc., but in this work we focus on a vision-based model that directly maps raw input images to steering angles using deep networks. This represents a nascent research topic in computer vision. The technical contributions of this work are two-fold. First, the model is learned and evaluated on real human driving videos that are time-synchronized with other vehicle sensors. This differs from many prior models trained from synthetic data in racing games. Second, state-of-the-art models, such as PilotNet, mostly predict the wheel angles independently on each video frame, which contradicts common understanding of driving as a stateful process. Instead, our proposed model strikes a combination of spatial and temporal cues, jointly investigating instantaneous monocular camera observations and vehicle's historical states. This is in practice accomplished by inserting carefully-designed recurrent units (e.g., LSTM and Conv-LSTM) at proper network layers. Our experimental study is based on about 6 hours of human driving data provided by Udacity. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model, even under scenarios like drastic lighting changes and abrupt turning. The comparison with other state-of-the-art models clearly reveals its superior performance in predicting the due wheel angle for a self-driving car. &copy; 2017 ACM."

Although trajectory demonstrations can be very informative of the desired objective, they can also be difficult for users to provide. Answers to comparison queries, asking which of two trajectories is preferable, are much easier for users, and have emerged as an effective alternative. Unfortunately, comparisons are far less informative. We propose that there is much richer information that users can easily provide and that robots ought to leverage. We focus on augmenting comparisons with feature queries, and introduce a unified formalism for treating all answers as observations about the true desired reward. We derive an active query selection algorithm, and test these queries in simulation and on real users. We find that richer, feature-augmented queries can extract more information faster, leading to robots that better match user preferences in their behavior."

Soft hands are compliant and capable of handling uncertainty in sensing and actuation, but come at the cost of unpredictable deformation of the soft fingers. Traditional model-driven grasping approaches, which assume known models for objects, robot hands, and stable grasps with expected contacts, are inapplicable to such soft hands, since predicting contact points between objects and soft hands is not straightforward. Our solution adopts a deep CNN approach to find good caging grasps for previously unseen objects by learning effective features and a classifier from point cloud data. Unlike recent CNN models applied to robotic grasping which have been trained on 2D or 2.5D images and limited to a fixed top grasping direction, we exploit the power of a 3D CNN model to estimate suitable grasp poses from multiple grasping directions (top and side directions) and wrist orientations, which has great potential for geometry-related robotic tasks. Our soft hands guided by the 3D CNN algorithm show 87% successful grasping on previously unseen objects.

This is called allocative efficiency (AE). We need the agents to report their valuations for obtaining these resources, truthfully referred to as dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). Typically, we use auction-based mechanisms to achieve AE and DSIC. However, due to Green-Laffont Impossibili ty Theorem, we cannot ensure budget balance in the system while ensuring AE and DSIC. That is, the net transfer of money cannot be zero. This problem has been addressed by designing a redistrib ution mechanism so as to ensure minimum surplus of money as well as AE and DSIC. The objective could be to minimize surplus in expectation or in the worst case and these p objects could be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Designing of such mechanisms is non-trivial. Especially, designing redistribution mechanisms which perform well in expectation becomes analytically challenging for heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we take a completely different, data-driven app roach. We train a neural network to determine an optimal redistrib ution mechanism based on given settings with both the objectives, optimal in expectation and optimal in the worst case. We also prop ose a loss function to train a neural network to optimize worst case. We design neural networks with the underlying rebate funct ions being linear as well as nonlinear in terms of bids of the agents. Our networks' performances are same as the theoretical guarant ees for the cases where it has been solved. We observe that a neural network based redistribution mechanism for homogeneous settings which uses nonlinear rebate functions outperforms line ar rebate functions when the objective is optimal in expectation. Our approach also yields an optimal in expectation redistribution mechanism for heterogeneous settings."

Xing.Many applications in speech, robotics, finance, and biology deal with sequential data, where ordering matters and recurrent structures are common. However, this structure cannot be easily captured by standard kernel functions. To model such structure, we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes. The resulting model, GP-LSTM, fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure, and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application, where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP-LSTM are uniquely valuable."

The overall goal is to allow the robot to improve upon a standard exploration technique by utilizing background knowledge from previously seen, similar environments. We present two conceptually different approaches. Whereas the first method, which is the focus of this article, is a reactive search technique that decides where to search next only based on local information about the objects in the robot's vicinity, the second algorithm is a more global and inference-based approach that explicitly reasons about the location of the target object given all observations made so far. While the model underlying the first approach can be learned from data of optimal search paths, we learn the model of the second method from object arrangements of example environments. Our application scenario is the search for a product in a supermarket. We present simulation and real-world experiments in which we compare our strategies to alternative methods and also to the performance of humans. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We observe temporal relationships at the subtask level of expert demonstrations, and determine the different strategies employed in order to successfully complete a task. To capture the relationship between the subtasks and the overall goal, we utilise two external memory modules, one for capturing depend encies within a single expert demonstration, such as the sequential relationship among different sub tasks, and a global memory modu le for modelling task level characteristics such as best practice employed by different humans based on their domain expertise. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the hidden state representation of the memory can be used as a reward signal to smooth the state transitions, eradicating subtle changes. We evaluate the effectiven ess of the proposed model for an autonomous highway driving application, where we demonstrate its capability to learn different expert policies and outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Wireless software-defined-network (SDN) enabled massive machine-type communications (mMTC) network architecture is agreed as a promising candidate to support feasible management on wireless monitoring devices in E-health system. The existing anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in SDN-mMTC involves periodically traffic uploading for monitoring and model re-training, leading to big scalability issues in E-health system. Therefore, this paper proposes a Localized Evolving Semi-supervised Learning Based Anomaly detection scheme (LESLA), which employs the idea of offline training plus online testing to allow running localized ADS to be feasible on wireless mMTC devices. Besides, LESLA adopts semi-supervised learning together with contrastive pessimistic likelihood estimation (CPLE) to enable the selfevolving during anomaly detection. Such design results in promising good performance even in the case of outlier or infrequent model renewal. Furthermore, CPLE LESLA scheme is proposed to further improve the performance of LESLA. The theoretical analysis and the simulation are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of LESLA scheme in mMTC."

Control rats were injected with the vehicle solution only. The stomach, ileum and colon were dissected and investigated for histopathological changes with a light microscope as well as for topographical changes with a scanning electron microscope. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA, a biomarker of oxidative damage) and glutathione (GSH, a biomarker of protective oxidative injury) were also determined in all dissected tissues. In the WAS group, the stomach epithelium showed ulceration in some areas, dilatations of the gastric glands, degeneration of gastric glandular cells, and prominent congestion of the capillaries. In a similar fashion, degenerated epithelium and severe vascular congestions were observed in the ileum and colon. In all the tissues dense inflammatory cell infiltration and mast cell degranulation in mucosa were observed. The levels of MDA were significantly increased whereas those of GSH were significantly decreased in all test tissues in the WAS group compared to the control group. The morphology of gastric, ileal and colonic mucosa in WAS+ML group showed a significant amelioration showing a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration and mast cell degranulation. Increased MDA and decreased GSH levels in the WAS group were also ameliorated with ML treatment.

The main idea is to leverage the semantic information provided by the user activities and the accurate metric map created by an assistive robot. The conceptual information is modeled as a probabilistic chain-graph. The user is equipped with only a smart watch, and we detect complex activities and a coarse trajectory using inertial data. We perform activity detection using a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network. The robot is equipped with an RGB-D camera, and creates a topological map of the environment. Both the user and the robot build a conceptual map composed by room categories on top of the low-level trajectory. When the robot and the user meet, the user's conceptual map is fused with the robot's conceptual map. The robot is able to match activities with types of rooms, learning a semantic representation of the environment over time (room types), while the user is able to be localized at room level by exploiting the precise map built by the robot. Preliminary ongoing tests show the feasibility of the approach."

The main problem of the previous beam-model-based algorithms is that they cannot detect and track dynamic vehicles that are occluded by other objects. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic vehicle detection and tracking algorithm to solve this problem for our autonomous land vehicle (ALV), which is equipped with a Velodyne LIDAR and a GPS-aid inertial navigation system. For detection, our improved two-dimensional virtual scan is presented to detect the potential dynamic vehicles with a scan differencing operation. Then, for each potential dynamic vehicle, a novel likelihood-field-based vehicle measurement model is proposed to weight its possible poses. Finally, our newly modified scaling series algorithm and the importance sampling technique are adopted to estimate the initial pose and the corresponding velocity for each vehicle, respectively. The scaling series algorithm coupled with a Bayesian filter (SSBF) was previously used to handle the tactile localization problem in static background scenes. For tracking dynamic vehicles, we improve the SSBF by adding the ego-motion compensation so that the improved algorithm is able to update the pose and velocity for each vehicle in dynamic background scenes. Both the quantitative and qualitative experimental results validate the performance of our dynamic vehicle detection and tracking algorithm on the KITTI datasets and the Velodyne data collected by our ALV in dynamic urban environments."

Social media sites are emerging as promising platforms enabling disclosure around a variety of stigmatized concerns, including mental illness. What kind of behavioral changes precede and follow such disclosures? Do the therapeutic benefits of ""opening up"" manifest in these changes? In this paper, we address these questions by focusing on disclosures of schizophrenia diagnoses made on Twitter. We adopt a clinically grounded quantitative approach to first identify temporal phases around disclosure during which symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be significant. Then, to quantify behaviors before and after disclosures, we define linguistic measures drawing from literature on psycholinguistics and the socio-cognitive model of schizophrenia. Along with significant linguistic differences before and after disclosures, we find indications of therapeutic outcomes following disclosures, including improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions. We discuss the implications of social media as a new therapeutic tool in supporting disclosures of stigmatized conditions."

However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of the stock market. Exploding information on the Internet together with the advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enabled investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks (HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return."

This paper presents work towards autonomously localising drone controllers from the Radio Frequency (RF) signals they emit. An RF sensor array is used to monitor the signal spectrum. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to be able to predict the bearing of the drone controller, relative to the sensor, given its output. The position of the controllers can then be calculated from these bearings, provided that at least two such sensors are deployed a reasonable distance apart. The model is able to achieve a mean absolute error of 3.67°in bearing calculation, which translates into a moderate positional error of 40m at a range of 500m."

This would increase the performance of VANETs. A Kalman filter is employed for predicting the vehicle’s future location in this paper. We conducted experiments using both real vehicle mobility traces and model-driven traces. We quantitatively compare the prediction performance of a Kalman filter and neural network-based methods.

However, some academic staff hesitate to use a peer assessment approach for their classes due to concerns about its credibility and reliability. The focus of our research is to detect the credibility level of each assessment performed by students during peer assessment. We found three major scopes in assessing the credibility level of evaluations, 1) Informativity, 2) Accuracy, and 3) Consistency. We collect assessments, including comments and grades provided by students during the peer assessment process and then each feedback-and-grade pair is labeled with its credibility level by Mechanical Turk evaluators. We extract relevant features from each labeled assessment and use them to build a classifier that attempts to automatically assess its level of credibility in C5.0 Decision Tree classifier. The evaluation results show that the model can be used to automatically classify peer assessments as credible or non-credible, with accuracy in the range of 88%."

As a case study, this paper uses MDA-MB-231 breast cancer single-cells treated with the antidiabetic drug metformin. We show that mixture-model-based unsupervised methods with validation from hierarchical clustering can identify single-cell subpopulations (clusters). These clusters are characterized by a small set of genes (1% of the genome) that have significant differential expression across the clusters and are also highly correlated with pathways with anticancer effects driven by metformin. Among the identified small set of genes associated with reduced breast cancer incidence, laboratory experiments on one of the genes, CDC42, showed that its downregulation by metformin inhibited cancer cell migration and proliferation, thus validating the ability of machine learning approaches to identify biologically relevant candidates for laboratory experiments. Given the large size of the human genome and limitations in cost and skilled resources, the broader impact of this work in identifying a small set of differentially expressed genes after drug treatment lies in augmenting the drug-disease knowledge of pharmacogenomics experts in laboratory investigations, which could help establish novel biological mechanisms associated with drug response in diseases beyond breast cancer."

This work presents a 2-stage approach for indirect RFE estimation using front-view camera images captured from vehicles. In stage-1, convolutional neural network model architectures are implemented to learn region-specific features for road surface condition (RSC) classification. Texture-based features from the drivable surface, sky and surroundings are found to be separate regions of interest for dry, wet/water, slush and snow\ice RSC classification. In stage-2, a rule-based model that relies on domain-specific guidelines is implemented to segment the ego-lane drivable surface into [5×3] patches, followed by patch classification and quantization to separate images with high, medium and low RFE. The proposed method achieves average accuracy of 97% for RSC classification in stage-1 and 89% for RFE classification in stage-2, respectively. The 2-stage models are trained using publicly available data sets to enable benchmarking for future methodologies in the autonomous driving domain."

This process takes place both at an application's inception and in an evolutionary context as GUI changes keep pace with evolving features. Unfortunately, this practice is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an approach that automates this process by enabling accurate prototyping of GUIs via three tasks: detection, classification, and assembly. First, logical components of a GUI are detected from a mock-up artifact using either computer vision techniques or mock-up metadata. Then, software repository mining, automated dynamic analysis, and deep convolutional neural networks are utilized to accurately classify GUI-components into domain-specific types (e.g., toggle-button). Finally, a data-driven, K-nearest-neighbors algorithm generates a suitable hierarchical GUI structure from which a prototype application can be automatically assembled. We implemented this approach for Android in a system called ReDraw. Our evaluation illustrates that ReDraw achieves an average GUI-component classification accuracy of 91 percent and assembles prototype applications that closely mirror target mock-ups in terms of visual affinity while exhibiting reasonable code structure. Interviews with industrial practitioners illustrate ReDraw's potential to improve real development workflows."

We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit are often pushed into entrepreneurship in response to unexpected life disruptions, barriers to employment, and desire to benefit the community. Their resource-constrained contexts shape how they use social technologies, such as sharing economy tools and social media groups, particularly with respect to privacy, safety, and professional agency. We expand the discussion in CSCW around what it means to be an entrepreneur and provide implications for how social technologies can be designed to better meet the employment needs of people in resource-constrained communities."

Halide is domain-specific language and compiler designed to make it easier write high performance image processing code. It separates what is being computed from how to compute, enabling programmers to tune to find a high performance schedule. However, Halide applications suffer poor scalability on large number of CPU cores. In this paper, we first perform a detailed parallelism and performance analysis of Halide applications on a 4x8-physical core Linux system. Our analysis shows that page faults and contention on shared address space as well as unaligned packed data movements are part of reasons for poor scalability. To improve the performance of Halide, we propose a novel thread model-Sthread-and adopt it to reimplement Halide runtime, i.e. Shalide, without modifying the Halide language, compiler and the runtime interface. The Sthread model allows each thread has its own memory management structure, and directly shares heap objects, globals and stack data with other threads. On six image processing benchmarks, Shalide shows better speedup and gives up to 1.53x faster than the original Halide."

In multiagent systems, sub-problems are solved by autonomous agents that build organizational structures. Each agent internally further decomposes a problem by goal and plan hierarchies. The underlying design of a system reflects an engineers experience with approaching complex problems. It is desirable to reuse patterns and structures that proved their practical use and were validated (e.g. interaction protocols, goal hierarchies, behavior templates, organizational structures, etc.). This improves software quality and reduces development time and costs in the long run. Model-driven software engineering enables the separation of the platform independent design of the system under consideration and the actual implementation for a concrete execution platform. The gap between the different levels of abstraction is closed by model transformations. In this paper we propose a model-driven reverse engineering approach for lifting the underlying design of implemented multiagent systems to a platform independent level. For this purpose we specify conceptual mappings from the platform to our platform independent modeling language. The extracted structures have to be refined (e.g. by using existing platform independent artifacts) and can be re-used as blue print for solving similar problems on similar execution platforms. We evaluated our approach for the BDI agent platform Jadex and a real-world scenario. © 2011 IEEE."

Traditionally, the system model is composed of subsystem models at the same level of abstraction and with one particular view. However, in some cases the system model may comprise sub-system models at different levels of abstraction. Integration of these different abstraction level models imposes some important drawbacks which hinder the overall system simulations. These drawbacks need to be addressed to facilitate the simulation of systems composed with multi-level subsystem models. In this paper we report on modelling techniques for embedded and distributed systems to deal with this heterogeneity. We describe a methodology to (semi-)automatically generate an executable multi-level system simulation model starting from an abstract system architecture of the system.

This problem is constrained by factors like large number of cars, a need to perform updates quickly and securely, ability to do the update anywhere and any time, and delivering the often large update without harming the network. We present a scheduling approach for managing large FOTA downloads in a cellular network that combines historical network load with car usage and location analytics. The proposed approach uses a combination of heuristics and an optimized scheduler and applies them to schedule the admission of cars to download FOTA. Using real network data from a large cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over time. Simulation results show that our method improves over random uncontrolled approaches by (i) reducing median download startup delay by 48%, (ii) reducing the number of cars that don't complete the update by 10% and most importantly, (iii) reducing the load in busy cells by up to 37%."

Optimal harvests can be calculated based on a structured population model driven by data on abundance and the composition of bulls, cows, and calves obtained by aerial-survey monitoring during winter. Quotas are established by the respective government agency and licenses are issued to hunters to harvest an animal of specified age or sex during the following autumn. Because the cost of aerial monitoring is high, we use a Management Strategy Evaluation to evaluate the costs and benefits of periodic aerial surveys in the context of moose management. Our on-the-fly ""seat of your pants"" alternative to independent monitoring is management based solely on the kill of moose by hunters, which is usually sufficient to alert the manager to declines in moose abundance that warrant adjustments to harvest strategies. Harvests are relatively cheap to monitor; therefore, data can be obtained each year facilitating annual adjustments to quotas. Other sources of ""cheap"" monitoring data such as records of the number of moose seen by hunters while hunting also might be obtained, and may provide further useful insight into population abundance, structure and health. Because conservation dollars are usually limited, the high cost of aerial surveys is difficult to justify when alternative methods exist. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

One of these approaches is represented by the Mobile Multi-Robot systems (MMRSs). The introduction of this kind of systems opens a collection of new business and societal opportunities, but also raises many new challenges. Such systems are exposed to various spheres of uncertainty, spanning from software and hardware variability of a single robot to the one associated to mission planning and execution in possibly unforeseeable environments. In this proposal, we aim to identify how to preserve safety while enabling adaptability at run-time in MMRSs. The objective is to provide a modelling framework based on a methodology which explicitly takes into account safety and adaptability properties at run-time. In order to reach our goal, we plan to use Model-driven engineering(MDE) methods and techniques. Motivated from positive results from the application of MDE in other domains (e.g. avionics, automotive and telecommunications) we postulate that many methods used in this methodology are also relevant for MMRSs. With our work, we expect to give a contribution towards the assurance of safety and adaptability properties for MMRSs in a dynamic run-time context."

Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America."

All rights reserved.Mashups have emerged as an innovative software trend that re-interprets existing Web building blocks and leverages the composition of individual components in novel, value-adding ways. Additional appeal also derives from their potential to turn non-programmers into developers. Daniel and Matera have written the first comprehensive reference work for mashups. They systematically cover the main concepts and techniques underlying mashup design and development, the synergies among the models involved at different levels of abstraction, and the way models materialize into composition paradigms and architectures of corresponding development tools. The book deliberately takes a balanced approach, combining a scientific perspective on the topic with an in-depth view on relevant technologies. To this end, the first part of the book introduces the theoretical and technological foundations for designing and developing mashups, as well as for designing tools that can aid mashup development. The second part then focuses more specifically on various aspects of mashups. It discusses a set of core component technologies, core approaches, and architectural patterns, with a particular emphasis on tool-aided mashup development exploiting model-driven architectures. Development processes for mashups are also discussed, and special attention is paid to composition paradigms for the end-user development of mashups and quality issues. Overall, the book is of interest to a wide range of readers. Students, lecturers, and researchers will find a comprehensive overview of core concepts and technological foundations for mashup implementation and composition. Even without low-level coding details, practitioners like software architects will find guidance on key implementation concepts, architectural patterns, and development tools and approaches. A related website provides additional teaching material which can be used either as part of a course or for self study."

Through the further development all vehicle types gain a diverse amount of new functionality. Additional features have to be supported by the car's software. For time efficient accomplishment, usually the existing electronic control unit (ECU) code is extended. In the majority of cases this evolutionary development process is accompanied by a constant decay of the software architecture. This effect known as software erosion leads to an increasing deviation from the requirements specifications. To counteract the erosion it is necessary to continuously restore the architecture in respect of the specification. Automobile manufacturers cope with the erosion of their ECU software with varying degree of success. Successfully we applied a methodical and structured approach of architecture restoration in the specific case of the brake servo unit (BSU). Software product lines from existing BSU variants were extracted by explicit projection of the architecture variability and decomposition of the original architecture. After initial application, this approach was capable to restore the BSU architecture recurrently. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

This paper proposes a mathematical model that allows to address the location problem in a systematic way using captured data of discoverable devices on a wireless network. The data capture is done using a collaborative wireless sensors network that provides data about detected devices, geographical location, and time stamp of the sensor in the environment. We have also done a simple classification between mobile and fixed devices. The calculation of the estimated position is obtained through simulation of a set of devices in a given area and shows a high rate of accuracy in the classification of agents and a reasonable level of accuracy about the estimated position.

However, little information is available about its actual usage during software development and maintenance in the industry. Objective: The main aim of this work is investigating the level of maturity in the usage of software models and model driven engineering in the Italian industry. The perspective is that of software engineering researchers. Method: First, we conducted an exploratory personal opinion survey with 155 Italian software professionals. The data were collected with the help of a web-based on-line questionnaire. Then, we conducted focused interviews with three software professionals to interpret doubtful results. Results: Software modelling is a very relevant phenomenon in the Italian industry. Model driven techniques are used in the industry, even if (i) only for a limited extent, (ii) despite a quite generalized dissatisfaction about available tools and (iii) despite a generally low experience of the IT personnel in such techniques. Limitations: Generalization of results is limited due to the sample size. Moreover, possible self-exclusion from participants not interested in modelling could have biased the results. Conclusion: Results reinforce existing evidence regarding the usage of software modelling and (partially of) model driven engineering in the industry but highlight several aspects of immaturity of the Italian industry."

We describe demographic correlates, comorbidity, and history of mental disorders and suicidality in a large sample of male sexual minority youth.Methods Structured diagnostic interviews were conducted with 449 racially diverse urban sexual minority males, aged 16-20 years, who were recruited using a social network-driven sampling methodology.Results Lifetime major depressive episode (MDE) affected 33.2% of the youth. Lifetime conduct disorder (23.6%), alcohol abuse/dependence (19.6%), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 16.0%), and nicotine dependence (10.7%) were also common. Black participants were less likely than white participants to be diagnosed with lifetime MDE, alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, suicidal ideation, and anorexia, as well as past 12-month alcohol abuse/dependence (odds ratios [ORs] range from.08 to.46). Relative to participants identifying as gay, bisexual identified youth were at higher risk for lifetime PTSD (OR = 2.04), and participants who did not identify as gay or bisexual were at higher risk for both lifetime and past 12-month nicotine dependence (OR = 4.36 and 3.46, respectively). Most participants with mental disorders never received treatment, and comorbidity was common.Conclusions MDE, conduct disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, PTSD, and nicotine dependence are common and infrequently treated in young sexual minority men. Some within-group disparities emerged, suggesting that factors related to racial background and self-identification may help to understand resilience to the unique stressors experienced by these young men."

However, manually setting these parameters to their optimal values not only needs in-depth knowledge on Hadoop as well as the job itself, but also requires a large amount of time and efforts. Automatic approaches have therefore been proposed. Their usage, however, is still quite limited due to the intolerably long searching time. In this paper, we introduce MapreducE Self-Tuning (MEST), a framework that accelerates the searching process for the optimal configuration of a given Hadoop application. We have devised a novel mechanism by integrating the model trees algorithm with the genetic algorithm. As such, MEST significantly reduces the searching time by removing unnecessary profiling, modeling, and searching steps, which are mandatory for existing approaches. Our experiments using five benchmarks, each with two input data sets (DS1 and 2× DS1) show that MEST improves the searching efficiency (SE) by factors of 1.37× and 2.18× on average respectively over the state-of-the-art approach."

And then the task assignment problem with multiple constraints is solved by improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm which is suitable for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile, we make some modification for the PSO to suit for the acquirement of mutually exclusive. The basic principle and simulation steps of the improved PSO algorithm is described in detail. And a simulation example is given. Furthermore, we compare PSO with Genetic Algorithm. The simulation results show that this algorithm is efficient to solve the problem of task assignment for UAV."

These requirements lead to the use of the principles of Model-Driven Development (MDD) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for the construction of software applications, allowing the generation of models at different levels of abstraction, with the possibility of generating software implementation artifacts (code) on different platforms, as well as allow the decomposition of complex and monolithic systems into loosely coupled components. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on the MDD for solving the challenges in the IoT system developments. The methodology is composed of four phases with different levels of abstraction, viewpoint, granularity, and service-oriented. Furthermore, a set of MDD methods for the transformation of models using formal rules are proposed. We present a smart vehicle scenario in which the methodology and methods are implemented, allowing the generation of executable code as a component of a real-time system. In addition, an architecture for IoT systems composed of four layers is presented, which is based on the SOA approach. In this way, the methodology and the architecture allow the interoperability (from the perspective of models and software components) between heterogeneous devices to be guaranteed in multiple ways, establishing a bridge between the digital and physical world of the IoT domain."

User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday wisdom, cannot be expected to address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple value systems come into play. We explore the potential of phronesis, a concept from Aristotelian virtue ethics, for mHealth design. Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self-reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing."

Users access a MicroISP via a low-cost, high-bandwidth LAN, e.g. Ethernet or WaveLAN. A router connects the MicroISP's LAN to a shared high-bandwidth access link (e.g., DSL or cable) to a conventional ISP. For this service, a MicroISP charges its clients. The architecture supports a variety of payment methods, both offline (e.g., cash, credit card, or billing to a hotel room account) and online (e.g., eCash, SET, IBM Micro Payments, or Millicent). MicroISPs use IPSec's IKE protocol for securely exchanging authentication keys with paying users. Paying users use IPSec's AH protocol in tunnel mode to authenticate each packet they send. Therefore, MicroISPs can easily detect and drop packets of nonpaying users. A MicroISP must present to users a certificate signed by a recognized authority, but a user may simply present a self-signed certificate, as long as the user pays for service. Regardless of how online payment is implemented, it runs on the user's authenticated tunnel, and therefore can be securely bound to it. The MicroISP protocol allows users to monitor and control usage and supports recovery in case of a MicroISP or user computer crash."

The device is designed for the capture of low and high resolution images, providing multispectral and colour images, and for 3-D mapping of soil or rock samples. The system consists of a microscope equipped with a monochromatic CMOS sensor, a pattern projector and active multispectral illumination. The compact and lightweight device is intended to be mounted on the robotic arm of a planetary exploration rover developed by the CSA. In image capture mode, the microscope operates on a quite large 400-900 nm spectral band. The illumination of the samples is done using LEDs of different colors turned ON and OFF in sequence providing calibrated reflectance images as well as synthesized color images. Fluorescence imaging is supported by UV illumination at 365 nm. The microscope consists only of fixed optical components. Changing the numerical aperture and resolution of the microscope is done by changing the diameter of the system aperture stop and by pixel binning. The 3-D mapping is done with the Moiré phase shift method. The projection of the Moiré patterns on samples is done with a specially designed video projector equipped with a TI DLP while the microscope acts as the camera. Both the microscope and the projector are modified Offner reflective configurations. The system allows the generation of superb high resolution color images with very large depth of field (focus stacking) or color textured 3-D maps from a set of images acquired at different heights using the 3-D map for the segmentation of the in-focus pixels in each image.

Despite this success, we remain some distance from being able to create controlled, self-sustaining fusion reactions. Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) represents one leading design for the generation of energy by nuclear fusion. Since the 1950s, ICF has been supported by computing simulations, providing the mathematical foundations for pulse shaping, lasers, and material shells needed to ensure effective and efficient implosion. The research presented here focuses on one such simulation code, EPOCH, a fully relativistic particle-in-cell plasma physics code, developed by a leading network of over 30 UK researchers. A significant challenge in developing large codes like EPOCH is maintaining effective scientific delivery on successive generations of high-performance computing architecture. To support this process, we adopt the use of mini-applications - small code proxies that encapsulate important computational properties of their larger parent counterparts. Through the development of a mini-app for EPOCH (called miniEPOCH), we investigate known time-step scaling issues within EPOCH and explore possible optimisations: (i) Employing loop fission to increase levels of vectorisation, (ii) Enforcing particle ordering to allow the exploitation of domain specific knowledge and, (iii) Changing underlying data storage to improve memory locality. When applied to EPOCH, these improvements represent a 2.02× speed-up in the core algorithm and a 1.55× speed-up to the overall application runtime, when executed on EPCC's Cray XC30 ARCHER platform."

While most of the previous studies focused only on the locomotion on flat surfaces, in this article, we tackle with the problem of bipedal locomotion in rough terrains by using a minimalistic control architecture for the compass gait walking model. This controller utilizes an open-loop sinusoidal oscillation of hip motor, which induces basic walking stability without sensory feedback. A set of simulation analyses show that the underlying mechanism lies in the ""phase locking"" mechanism that compensates phase delays between mechanical dynamics and the open-loop motor oscillation resulting in a relatively large basin of attraction in dynamic bipedal walking. By exploiting this mechanism, we also explain how the basin of attraction can be controlled by manipulating the parameters of oscillator not only on a flat terrain but also in various inclined slopes. Based on the simulation analysis, the proposed controller is implemented in a real-world robotic platform to confirm the plausibility of the approach. In addition, by using these basic principles of self-stability and gait variability, we demonstrate how the proposed controller can be extended with a simple sensory feedback such that the robot is able to control gait patterns autonomously for traversing a rough terrain. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Event-oriented topics are highly related to such events as it can provide explicit descriptions of what have happened in social community. In many real-world cases, however, it is difficult to include all attributes of microblogs, more often, textual aspects only are available. Traditional topic modelling methods have failed to generate event-oriented topics with the textual aspects, since the inherent relations between topics are often overlooked in these methods. Meanwhile, the metrics in original word vocabulary space might not effectively capture semantic distances. Our UMHE framework overcomes the severe information deficiency and poor feature representation. The UMHE first develops a multi-view Bayesian rose tree to preliminarily generate prior knowledge for latent topics and their relations. With such prior knowledge, we design an unsupervised translation-based hierarchical embedding method to make a better representation of these latent topics. By applying self-adaptive spectral clustering on the embedding space and the original space concomitantly, we eventually extract event-oriented topics in word distributions to express social events. Our framework is purely data-driven and unsupervised, without any external knowledge. Experimental results on TREC Tweets2011 dataset and Sina Weibo dataset demonstrate that the UMHE framework can construct hierarchical structure with high fitness, but also yield topic embeddings with salient semantics; therefore, it can derive event-oriented topics with meaningful descriptions."

In this paper, we explore the use of historical data to automatically predict traffic bottlenecks and make rapid decisions in a wireless (WiFi-like) network on a smaller scale. This is now possible with software defined networks (SDN), whose controllers can have a global view of traffic flows in a network. Models such as classification trees can be used to quickly make decisions on how to manage network resources based on the quality needs, service level agreement or other criteria provided by a network administrator. The objective of this paper is to use data generated by simulation tools to see if such classification models can be developed and to evaluate their efficacy. For this purpose, extensive simulation data was collected and data mining techniques were then used to develop QoS prediction trees. Such trees can predict the maximum delay that results due to specific traffic situations with specific parameters.We evaluated these decision trees by placing them in an SDN controller. OpenFlow cannot directly provide the necessary information for managing wireless networks so we used POX messenger to set up an agent on each AP for adjusting the network. We explored the possibility of updating the tree using feedback from hosts. Our results show that such trees are effective in managing the network and decreasing maximum packet delay."

These tasks include activity generation, sequencing, spacecraft analysis, and failure recovery. The RA will be demonstrated as a flight experiment on Deep Space One (DS1), the first deep space mission of the NASA's New Millennium Program (NMP). As we moved from prototyping into actual flight code development and teamed with ground operators, we made several major extensions to the RA architecture to address the broader operational context in which RA would be used. These extensions support ground operators and the RA sharing a long-range mission profile with facilities for asynchronous ground updates; support ground operators monitoring and commanding the spacecraft at multiple levels of detail simultaneously; and enable ground operators to provide additional knowledge to the RA, such as parameter updates, model updates, and diagnostic information, without interfering with the activities of the RA or leaving the system in an inconsistent state. The resulting architecture supports incremental autonomy, in which a basic agent can be delivered early and then used in an increasingly autonomous manner over the lifetime of the mission. It also supports variable autonomy, as it enables ground operators to benefit from autonomy when they want it, but does not inhibit them from obtaining a detailed understanding and exercising tighter control when necessary. These issues are critical to the successful development and operation of autonomous spacecraft."

However, recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations at testing time. Specifically, suppose we have a testing example, whose label can be correctly predicted by a DNN classifier. An attacker can add a small carefully crafted noise to the testing example such that the DNN classifier predicts an incorrect label, where the crafted testing example is called adversarial example. Such attacks are called evasion attacks. Evasion attacks are one of the biggest challenges for deploying DNNs in safety and security critical applications such as self-driving cars. In this work, we develop new DNNs that are robust to stateof-the-Art evasion attacks. Our key observation is that adversarial examples are close to the classification boundary. Therefore, we propose region-based classification to be robust to adversarial examples. Specifically, for a benign/adversarial testing example, we ensemble information in a hypercube centered at the example to predict its label. In contrast, traditional classifiers are point-based classification, i.e., given a testing example, the classifier predicts its label based on the testing example alone. Our evaluation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our region-based classification can significantly mitigate evasion attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy on benign examples. Specifically, our region-based classification achieves the same classification accuracy on testing benign examples as point-based classification, but our region-based classification is significantly more robust than point-based classification to state-of-The-Art evasion attacks."

However, current approaches do not support updating of the specification to reflect changes in the service market, like newly available services or improved QoS of existing ones. Thus, even if the specification models reflect design-time acceptable requirements they may become obsolete and miss opportunities for system improvement by self-adaptation. This articles proposes to distinguish ""abstract"" and ""concrete"" specification models: the former consists of linguistic variables (e.g. ""fast"") agreed upon at design time, and the latter consists of precise numeric values (e.g. ""2ms"") that are dynamically calculated at run-time, thus incorporating up-to-date QoS information. If and when freshly calculated concrete specifications are not satisfied anymore by the current service configuration, an adaptation is triggered. The approach was validated using four simulated SBS that use services from a previously published, real-world dataset; in all cases, the system was able to detect unsatisfied requirements at run-time and trigger suitable adaptations. Ongoing work focuses on policies to determine recalculation of specifications. This approach will allow engineers to build SBS that can be protected against market-caused obsolescence of their requirements specifications. © 2012 IEEE."

The course is offered in a variety of thematic ""flavors"" that leverage a student's pre-existing interests (e.g. in music or art), but all share the common goals of introducing students to the basics of programming, teamwork, and college-level study. While there is overlap in overall goals, the courses vary drastically in topic matter (e.g. robotics, gaming, music, computational art, mobile apps, security) and in pedagogical approach (e.g. principles of design, project-based student driven learning, and traditional topic-based programming modules). The introduction of this CS0 course has increased students' commitment to their major and success in follow-on classes. We present these successes and show that student GPAs in a followon object oriented programming course do not vary significantly for the differing subtopics and teaching pedagogies employed in the various flavors. Our report includes examining two student subgroups (those experienced with programming and those new to programming). Our evaluations suggest that the existence and goal of the course matter more than the specific content, with all subtopics and pedagogical approaches performing well."

While accretion disk models driven by a generic turbulent viscosity have been invoked as a means to explain such large-scale transport, the detailed physics behind such an ""alpha"" viscosity remains unclear. We present here an alternative physical mechanism for large-scale transport in the solar nebula: gravitational torques associated with the transient spiral arms in a marginally gravitationally unstable disk, of the type that appears to be necessary to form gas giant planets. Three dimensional models are presented of the time evolution of self-gravitating disks, including radiative transfer and detailed equations of state, showing that small dust grains will be transported upstream and downstream (with respect to the mean inward flow of gas and dust being accreted by the central protostar) inside the disk on time scales of less than 1000 yr inside 10 AU. These models furthermore show that any initial spatial heterogeneities present (e.g., in short-lived isotopes such as 26Al) will be homogenized by disk mixing down to a level of ~ 10%, preserving the use of short-lived isotopes as accurate nebular chronometers, while simultaneously allowing for the spread of stable oxygen isotope ratios. This finite level of nebular spatial heterogeneity appears to be related to the coarse mixing achieved by spiral arms, with radial widths of order 1 AU, over time scales of ~ 1000 yr. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The environment map is first converted with a signed fitness function that encodes the distance to the nearest obstacle from a given location. Using the end-point model of a laser beam, captured sensor data are associated with the world model without data association or feature extraction. The PSO is then performed to explore the pose space to search for the correct robot pose iteratively, in which the potential solutions are optimized by scan matching technique to get more accurate pose estimation. The proposed approach performs better than the popular particle filter based approach with regard to convergence speed, estimation precision and computational cost. Experiment results based on public domain dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm."

If the channel gain is poor (due to fading), the robot can move (a small distance) to another location to improve the channel gain and so compensate for fading. Techniques using this principle are called mobility diversity algorithms (MDAs). MDAs intelligently explore a number of points to find a location with high channel gain while using little mechanical energy during the exploration. Until now, the location of these points has been predetermined. In this paper, we show how we can adapt their positions by using channel predictors. Our results show that MDAs, which adapt the location of those points, can in fact outperform (in terms of the channel gain obtained and mechanical energy used) the MDAs that use predetermined locations for those points. These results will significantly improve the performance of the MDAs and consequently allow MRs to mitigate poor wireless channel conditions in an energy-efficient manner."

These nodes communicate wirelessly in a self-organized, self-configured and self-Administered manner. Since mobile nodes move arbitrary on the fly, they cause frequents link failure which impact network performances and data traffic delivery. Therefore, the task of finding and maintaining an appropriate route between a pair of nodes constitute the main issue in designing routing protocols for MANET. In addition to network topology changes, another intrinsic limitations of MANET, such as limited bandwidth, limited power and processing capabilities of mobile nodes, make routing process more complex and challenging. Several routing protocols have been proposed and developed. Each routing protocol have shown better performances under specific network conditions, such as mobility level, traffic pattern and network size. In this paper we studied routing operations of common MANET routing protocols and we discussed how far are those routing protocols efficient in high dynamic context."

However, post-handover delay is a problem for delay-sensitive mobile applications, as they need to (re-)submit their subscriptions and wait for them to get resolved and (probably re-) transmitted before receiving the demanded data. To avoid this problem and optimize performance, this paper proposes a Mobilitybased Proactive Multicast (MPM) scheme. Unlike reactive or blind multicast solutions proposed in the past, MPM takes autonomous decisions locally at various network access points (cells) prior to the movement of mobile clients, using a semi-Markov mobility prediction model that predicts next-cell transitions, along with anticipating the duration between the transitions for an arbitrary user in a cellular network. Since cellular backhaul links are typically a bottleneck, MPM trades-off effectively part of the capacity of the (congested) backhaul link for a decreased delay experienced by users after handovers thanks to a congestion pricing scheme used for backhaul capacity allocation. Our preliminary performance evaluation results show that MPM captures well the temporal locality of mobile requests due to the semi-Markov mobility prediction model, hence it achieves a better performance compared to both a (i) blind/naïve multicast and a (ii) content popularity-based proactive multicast."

This thesis proposes to investigate the idea taking a mockup-centric approach instead, in which self-contained, full page web mockups are the central artifact driving the application development process. In some cases, these mockups are sufficient to infer the dynamic application structure completely. This approach to mockup driven development is made possible by the development of a language the thesis develops, called Cascading Tree Sheets (CTS), that enables a mockup to be annotated with enough information so that many common web development tasks and workflows can be eliminated or vastly simplified. CTS describes and encapsulates a web page's design structure the same way CSS describes its styles. This enables mockups to serve as the input of a web application rather than simply a design artifact. Using this capability, I will study the feasibility and usability of mockup driven development for a range of novice and expert authorship tasks. The thesis aims to finish by demonstrating that the functionality of a domain-specific content management system can be inferred automatically from site mockups."

In this paper, a mode-driven discriminant analysis (MDA) in tensor subspace is proposed for visual recognition. For training, we treat each sample as an N-order tensor, of which the first N-1 modes capture the spatial information of images while the N-th mode captures the sequential patterns of images. We employ Fisher criteria on the first N-1 modes to extract discriminative features of the visual information. After that, considering the correlation of adjacent frames in the sequence, i.e., the current frame and its former and latter ones, we update the sequence by calculating the correlation of triple adjacent frames, then perform discriminant analysis on the N-th mode. The alternating projection procedure of MDA converges and is convex with different initial values of the transformation matrices. Such hybrid tensor subspace learning scheme may sufficiently preserve both discrete and continuous distributions information of action videos in lower dimensional spaces to boost discriminant power. Experiments on the MSR action 3D database, KTH database and ETH database showed that our algorithm MDA outperformed other tensor-based methods in terms of accuracy and is competitive considering the time efficiency. Besides, it is robust to deal with the damaged and self-occluded action silhouettes and RGB object images in various viewing angles."

This paper presents a model that establishes a relationship between the pressure, torque due to axial loading, and axial rotation to enable a model-driven open-loop control for FREEs. The modeling technique relies on describing force equilibrium between the fiber, fluid, and an elastomer model which is computed via system identification. The model is experimentally tested as these variables are changed, illustrating that it provides good agreement with the real system.

This is especially the case when interesting, potentially disruptive, realms are investigated. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and co-working is a hot topic today, with robots becoming every day more pervasive in our lives. Nevertheless, many developers and researchers do not pay enough attention on the incredible consequences that an attack on or a failure of a robot may pose for the human companion or co-worker.

It also contributed to increase the popularity and availability of software libraries developed for embedded systems, such as Intels MRAA and its higher-level version UPM. Besides this evolution, the design of embedded systems that requires controlling complex physical devices (namely Cyber-Physical Systems - CPS) still needs attention from the research community. Model Driven Engineering has been applied as a possible solution to help the development of these highly complex systems. However, analyzing the existing MDE design tools, it is observed that there is a little support to the automated design of the sensing and actuation subsystems. For this reason, the present paper provides a MDE solution that allows the designers to represent and integrate the sensing and actuation subsystems on the applications, using as input a sensors and actuators library and a functional specification of the control system. The proposed approach applies a transformation process that aims to guide the designer to bind the control specification to the proper sensors and actuators belonging to the library. The tool named ECPSModeling was developed to support the proposed activities, as detailed along the paper. The design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to illustrate the proposed approach."

These types of system are increasingly interconnected via wireless and wireline networks to form systems of systems. A challenging requirement for these DRE systems involves supporting a diverse set of quality of service (QoS) properties, such as predictable latency/jitter, throughput guarantees, scalability, 24x7 availability, dependability, and security that must be satisfied simultaneously in real-time. Although increasing portions of DRE systems are based on QoS-enabled commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software components, the complexity of managing long lifecycles (often ∼15-30 years) remains a key challenge for DRE developers and system integrators. For example, substantial time and effort is spent retrofitting DRE applications when the underlying COTS technology infrastructure changes. This paper provides two contributions that help improve the development, validation, and integration of DRE systems throughout their lifecycles. First, we illustrate the challenges in creating and deploying QoS-enabled component middleware-based DRE applications and describe our approach to resolving these challenges based on a new software paradigm called Model Driven Middleware (MDM), which combines model-based software development techniques with QoS-enabled component middleware to address key challenges faced by developers of DRE systems - particularly composition, integration, and assured QoS for end-to-end operations. Second, we describe the structure and functionality of CoSMIC (Component Synthesis using Model Integrated Computing), which is an MDM toolsuite that addresses key DRE application and middleware lifecycle challenges, including partitioning the components to use distributed resources effectively, validating software configurations, assuring multiple simultaneous QoS properties in real-time, and safeguarding against rapidly changing technology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An important research question is how quality of service models can inform runtime adaptation. We sketch one solution to this question by application of control theory to improve performance of queued systems by means of architectural adaptation. Previous research by our group has shown how Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average techniques can be utilized to forecast how Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics are likely to evolve in the near future. This is particularly important in cases where systems can be adapted to counter QoS constraint violations. In this paper, we show how, given a similar type of QoS characteristic forecasts, strategies of architectural adaptation can be implemented that pre-emptively avoid QoS violations. The novelty of our approach is that we use classical control theory to ensure that our adaptation strategies are stable, in the sense that they do not oscillate between choices. We provide a description of how our control theoretic model can be implemented using context-based interception in .NET via model driven engineering. © JOT, 2007."

An important research question is how quality of service models can enabled self-healing systems. This paper presents a solution to the problem for service-oriented architectures. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) consist of a group of independent computational services, with communication between services being managed and maintained via external orchestration. We employ dynamic programming, a form of optimal control theory, to reconfigure SOA orchestration. Reconfiguration occurs when a performance constraint over the orchestration - a global service level agreement (SLA) - is violated. Currently, reconfiguration may take the form of re-directing and load-balancing of calls to services that offer equivalent functionality, but better performance. Previous experiments by Poernomo and Akzhalova involved application of optimal control theory to determine reconfiguration policies for a single service. This paper presents a significant improvement, as we now consider entire orchestrations of services. Furthermore, by utilizing dynamic programming, our new approach has the advantage of determining adaptation policies from a given discrete set of choices."

We propose an overview of these challenges. Methods: Models play a major role in representing the relevant knowledge to plan and realize complex medical and surgical interventions. We analyze the three basic steps of Perception, Decision and Action, and illustrate by some instances how models may be integrated in these steps. Results: We propose a selection of the results obtained in Model Driven Therapy. These results illustrate the issues of Perception (models allow accurate reconstruction of 3D objects from a limited set of X-ray projections), Decision (models allow to take into account elastic and dynamic characteristics of muscles), and Action (models allow to design innovative navigational and robotics aids to the realization of complex interventions).

Existing models for software licenses and service standards, such as WDSL fall short of providing flexible frameworks for capturing the requirements that this newly created environment demands. Gaps exist in support for multi-pricing agreements across multiple providers and consumers, support for both usage and capacity events and automated generation and composition of licenses. Developers are accustomed to self-serve model, where they create and deploy new applications on the Cloud with a few mouse clicks, employing one or more available APIs. As a result, there is a need to be able to automatically assess existing licenses, compose new ones and understand their dependencies in order to shorten the time-to-value for new services. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for defining API service licenses, which provides capabilities to capture business and legal constraints, enable license metric calculation, QoS calculation and service pricing rules. We present API SLA analyzer system, which utilizes proposed license model to uncover SLA violations in real-time."

Such a strategy is useful in yaw stabilisation of the vehicle. The proposed allocation strategy allows a modularisation of the control task, such that an upper level control system specifies a desired yaw moment to work on the EVs, while the control allocation is used to determine control inputs for four driving motors by commanding appropriate wheel slips. To avoid unintended side effects, skidding or discomforting the driver in critical driving condition, the MPC method, which permits us to consider constraints of actuating motors and slip ratio, is proposed to deal with this challenging problem. An analytical approach for the proposed controller is given and applied to evaluate the handing and stability of EVs. The experimental results show that the designed MPC allocation algorithm for motor torque has better performance in real time, and the control performance can be guaranteed in the real-time environment."

In practice, the key issues in MDO lie in the management of the interconnections between disciplines, along with the high number of simulations required to find a feasible multidisciplinary (optimal) solution. Therefore, in this paper, a novel approach is proposed, combining proper orthogonal decomposition to decrease the amount of data exchanged between disciplines, with surrogate models based on moving least squares to reduce disciplines. This method is applied to an original 2D wing demonstrator involving two disciplines (fluid and structure).

In this paper, we present the use of model transformations in the context of SoC co-design. Both the hardware part and the software part of a SoC can be represented as a model using the MARTE standard from the OMG. We introduce the use of Model-Driven Engineering in order to generate executable code from a self-contained model of SoC. First, we detail the restrictions and extensions we have brought to the MARTE profile in order to permit the complete description of the SoC as a model. The compilation is a sequence of small and maintainable transformations that allows to pass gradually from a high-level description into models closer in abstraction to the final model, which is then converted into code. An in-depth view of one of the several transformation chains composing our tool is given. The implementation relies on the use of our experimental Java-based transformation engine which uses a hybrid declarative-imperative language. We later discuss why model transformations fit better the compilation of the SoCs than traditional compilers. In particular, the re-use of transformations can greatly help with the fast evolution of SoC design, allowing development time reduction. Additionally, as each rule is small and relatively self-contained, their correctness is easier to ensure, which leads to more reliable compilation and indirectly more reliable SoCs. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

For the design phase, a machine-control-domain-specific modeling language and the supporting design environment are developed. With regard to the execution stage, a runtime framework compliant with the IEC 61499 standard is proposed. On the ground of the modeling environment and the reconfigurable run-time framework, a self-adaptive control module is developed to establish the close-loop self-reconfiguration infrastructure. The ontological representation of knowledge base toward this end is described, along with extendable SQWRL rules specified to automatically initiate the reconfiguration process in the cases of external user demands and internal faults. A prototype motion control kernel in the low-level layer of machine control system architecture is developed with the proposed modeling language and is then deployed to the run-time framework. Two case studies on self-reconfiguration of the proof-of-concept motion control kernel are demonstrated, which prove the feasibility of our proposal."

It will enable companies to form a connected ""smart manufacturing"" ecosystem having interconnections between the suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and even the products in order to provide better services to the end customer. However, due to the presence of heterogeneous systems that might not adhere to the industrial standards, there is a gap in achieving this vision of an interconnected ecosystem. In this paper, we focus on providing a solution for the modularity and interoperability issues related to the Industry 4.0 from a systems integration viewpoint. We propose a model-based approach for modular complex systems development by separating (1) the behavior model and (2) the implementation logic (execution) of the system. Moreover, we use unified modeling language (UML) based modeling techniques to model system behavior and connect the behavior models to the application programming interface (API) of the CPS. Thus, instead of generating source code for the CPS using models, we directly execute the CPS in the physical world via model execution. The model execution is supported by the standard execution semantics of UML. Using our approach, multiple heterogeneous systems can be modeled and integrated together to create a ""plug and play"" ecosystem needed for achieving the vision of Industry 4.0."

At one end of the spectrum, we have sophisticated agent-based software with hundreds of thousands of collaborating nodes. These require modeling abstractions relevant to their complex workflow tasks as well as predictable transforms and mappings for the requisite elaborations and refinements that must be accomplished in composing these systems. At the other end of the spectrum, we have ever-increasing capabilities of reconfigurable hardware devices such as field-programmable gate arrays to support the emerging adaptability and flexibility needs of these systems. From a model-based engineering perspective, these challenges are very similar; both must move their abstraction and reuse levels up to meet growing productivity and quality objectives. Model-based engineering and software system variants such as the model-driven architecture (MDA) are increasingly being applied to systems development as the engineering community recognizes the benefits of managing complexity, separating key concerns, and automating transformations from high-level abstract requirements down through the implementation. However, there are challenges when it comes to establishing the correct boundaries for change-tolerant parts of the system. Capabilities engineering (CE) is a promising approach for defining long-lived components of a system to ensure some sense of change tolerance. For innovative initiatives such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s autonomous nanotechology swarms (ANTS), the development and subsequent evolution of such systems are of considerable importance as their missions involve complex, collaborative behaviors across distributed, reconfigurable satellites. In this paper, we investigate the intersection of these two technologies as they support the development of complex, change-tolerant systems. We present an effective approach for bounding computationally independent models so that, as they transition to the architecture, capabilities-based groupings of components are relevant to the change-tolerant properties that must convey in the design solution space. The model-based engineering approach is validated via a fully functional prototype and verified by generating nontrivial multiagent systems and reusing components in subsequent systems. We build off of this research completed on the collaborative agent architecture, discuss the CE approach for the transition to architecture, and then examine how this will be applied in the reconfigurable computing community with the new National Science Foundation Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing. Based on this work and extrapolating from similar efforts, the model-based approach shows promise to reduce the complexities of software evolution and increase productivity - particularly as the model libraries are populated with canonical components. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007."

This methodology is based on Model-based Systems Engineering and produces models of the system as core assets. These models are used through the whole system life-cycle, from implementation or validation to operation and maintenance. On the application side, the ontological framework has been used to develop a metacontrol engineering technology for autonomous systems, the OM Engineering Process (OMEP), to improve their runtime adaptivity and resilience. OMEP has been applied to a mobile robot in the form of a metacontroller built on top of the robot's control architecture. It exploits a functional model of the robot (TOMASys Model) to reconfigure its control if required by the situation at runtime.

Prediction of the phenomenon on the network complicates the system further, requiring additional computation on themicrocontrollers and utilizing prediction models that are not typically designed for sensor networks. This paper describes a system architecture and deployment to meet the design requirements and to allow model-driven control, thereby optimizing the prediction capability of the system. We explore the application of river flood prediction using this architecture, describing our work on a centralized form of the prediction model, network implementation, component testing and infrastructure development in Honduras, deployment on a river in Massachusetts, and results of the field experiments. Our system uses only a small number of nodes to cover basins of 1000-10000 square km 2 using an unique heterogeneous communication structure to provide real-time sensed data, incorporating self-monitoring for failure, and adapting measurement schedules to capture events of interest. © 2008 ACM."

The touch sensor employed is a large-field tactile array. Object features appropriate for touch sensor recognition are extracted from a geometric model of an object, the dual spherical image. Both geometric and dynamic features are used to identify objects and their position and orientation on the touch sensor. Experiments show that geometric features extracted from the model are effective but that dynamic features must be determined empirically. Correct object identification rates, even for very similar objects, exceed 90 percent, a success rate much higher than would have been expected from only two-dimensional contact patterns. The position and orientation of objects, once identified, are very reliable. The authors conclude that large-field tactile sensors could prove very useful in the automatic palletizing problem when object models (from a computer-aided desiga system, for example) can be utilized. © 1989 IEEE"

We deal with this scenario, which reactive controllers are typically ill-equipped to handle, by making plausible predictions about the long- and short-term behavior of the target, and planning pursuit paths that will maximize the chance of seeing the target again. At the core of our pursuit method is the use of predictive models of target behavior, which help narrow down the set of possible future locations of the target to a few discrete hypotheses, as well as the use of combinatorial search in physical space to check those hypotheses efficiently. We model target behavior in terms of a learned navigation reward function, using Inverse Reinforcement Learning, based on semantic terrain features of satellite maps. Our pursuit algorithm continuously predicts the latent destination of the target and its position in the future, and relies on efficient graph representation and search methods in order to navigate to locations at which the target is most likely to be seen at an anticipated time. We perform extensive evaluation of our predictive pursuit algorithm over multiple satellite maps, thousands of simulation scenarios, against state-of-the art MDP and POMDP solvers. We show that our method significantly outperforms them by exploiting domain-specific knowledge, while being able to run in real-time."

In this paper, we present a domain-specific modeling language for the specification of concurrent tasks to be deployed on a single mobile device, even if that device has hand-written code on board. The language utilizes mobile device concepts as events, and synthesizes software that runs as independent services. For example, one task may be to send a text message with the current location, if the phone's battery is low in charge.

Correctly capturing the expected behavior in the model improves the system design so that is better defined and complete upon implementation. Additionally, performing model checking formally validates the behavior model against properties of correctness (assertions). The potential to generate and link additional model-based fault management products from the fault protection logical behavior model is key to projects adopting model driven design and retaining a single source of truth. When modeling heritage systems or if a dictionary-type database is needed, a standard for machine-readable import/export of fault management parameters allows for easier integration between flight software and the model-based products. Depending on if there is fault management information available while developing a behavior model, a method for auto-generating the model can be used that reduces human errors and speeds up the modeling process."

Previous studies of the MDD effectiveness showed that it significantly increases development productivity, because the development effort is focused on the business domain rather than technical issues. However, MDD was exploited in the context of agent-based development in a limited way, and most of the existing proposals demonstrated the effectiveness of using MDD in this context by argumentation or examples, lacking disciplined empirical analyses. In this paper, we explore the use of MDD for agent-based modeling and simulation in the adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) domain, in which autonomous agents are in charge of managing traffic light indicators to optimize traffic flow. We propose an MDD approach, composed of a modeling language and model-to-code transformations for producing runnable simulations automatically. In order to analyze the productivity gains of our MDD approach, we compared the amount of design and implementation artifacts produced using our approach and traditional simulation platforms. Results indicate that our approach reduces the workload to develop agent-based simulations in the ATSC domain."

This paper introduces an approach to support this assessment, with a focus on performance and dependability attributes. Our approach is based on the idea of defining a model transformation chain that maps a ""design oriented"" model of the system to an ""analysis oriented"" model that lends itself to the application of a suitable analysis methodology.

It is possible for a computer to achieve a qualitative analysis of software based on tracing dependencies through a body of code. This can reveal the propagation of any failure in the software, whatever the cause of the failure. Application of a higher level representation of the intended purpose of the software can then automatically interpret the implications of failure in terms of the requirements put on the software. These techniques have been used to automate the analysis of several thousand lines of code. They have been shown to provide useful results for software engineers, and would suit embedded software in vehicles for example. This work is not a cure-all for badly written software, but provides assistance in software analysis for well designed systems in low-level ""safe"" languages such as MISRA C. The software FMEA can be used to improve automated or source code embedded testing since tests can exonerate many potential faults allowing the FMEA analysis to present an engineer with a reduced set of potential faults. Model-driven development (MDD) is a software development philosophy which encourages the development of models of the software to be produced, for example using a language such as executable UML. The system is described in a platform independent manner, and then the software to be used is automatically generated from the model. In MDD, the models make the intentions of the programmer much more explicit than is the case for low-level pro gramming, and so the gap between the intended functions of the system and the description of the software is not so large. Representation of the design is much more explicit through use cases, component diagrams, state charts and sequence diagrams. All of this design information can be utilized for the automated generation of software FMEA. This means that FMEA for model-driven software can be done more easily than for a system implemented in a low-level language, because it is not necessary to attempt to reconstruct the intentions of the programmer from the functions of the system and the low-level code. The paper also discusses the advantages and dangers of doing such analysis at the design rather than the code level. © 2011 IEEE."

In this paper, we show how a Model-Driven AOSE methodology can be used for specifying the behavior of multi-robot teams. Specifically, the Agent Systems Engineering Methodology (ASEME) was used for developing the software that realizes the behavior of a physical robot team competing in the Standard Platform League of the RoboCup competition (the robot soccer world cup). The team consists of four humanoid robots, which play soccer autonomously in real time utilizing the on-board sensing, processing, and actuating capabilities, while communicating and coordinating with each other in order to achieve their common goal of winning the game. Our work focuses on the challenges of coordinating the base functionalities (object recognition, localization, motion skills) within each robot (intra-agent control) and coordinating the activities of the robots towards a desired team behavior (inter-agent control). We discuss the difficulties we faced and present the solutions we gave to a number of practical issues, which, in our view, are inherent in applying any AOSE methodology to robotics. We demonstrate the added value of using an AOSE methodology in the development of robotic systems, as ASEME allowed for a platform-independent team behavior specification, automated a large part of the code generation process, and reduced the total development time.

Self-adaptive UIs have been promoted as a solution for context variability due to their ability to automatically adapt to the context-of-use at runtime. Context modeling and context management are important prerequisites for supporting self-adaptive UIs, but introduce additional complexity since context information has to be captured using sensors from heterogeneous sources and dynamic context changes have to be monitored to enable UI adaptation at runtime. To overcome the complex and cumbersome task of context management, we present a model-driven approach for developing a flexible context manager supporting self-adaptive UIs. Our approach consists of a new context modeling language, named ContextML, for specification of various context-of-use situations. Based on the specified context model, our approach enables automatic generation of context services for monitoring context-of-use parameters. The benefit of our approach is demonstrated by a case study, where generated context services provide context information and trigger the adaptation of UIs for a university library web application."

The approach is based on code generation so that no additional library or process is needed on the smartphone to support different platforms. We introduce a UML2 profile to represent the elements of the application independently of the target platform; the behavior of the application is modeled as a finite-state machine while the graphical user interface is modeled by using classes and objects.

Until now, the most mature methodologies that have been proposed to develop software following MDD are mainly based on functional requirements by following the Object-Oriented Paradigm. Therefore, mature MDD methodologies are required for supporting the code generation from models that specify non-functional requirements. The Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) approach was created to provide explicit mechanisms for developing non-functional requirements through reusable elements called aspects. Aspect-Oriented Software Architectures (AOSA) emerged to deal with the design of both, functional requirements and non-functional requirements, which opened an important challenge in the software engineering field: the definition of a methodology for supporting the development of AOSAs following the MDD paradigm. This new methodology should allow the code generation from models which specify functional and non-functional requirements. This paper presents a mature approach, called PRISMA, which deals with this challenge. Therefore, this contribution takes a step forward in the area presenting in detail the PRISMA MDD process, which has been applied to generate the code of several real applications of the tele-operated robotics domain. PRISMA MDD approach provides complete support for the development of technology-independent AOSAs, which can be compiled from high-level, aspect-oriented architectural models into different technology platforms and languages following an MDD process. This contribution illustrates how to apply the PRISMA MDD approach through the modelling framework that has been developed to support it, and a case study of a tele-operated robot that has been completely developed using this approach. Finally, the results obtained from the application of PRISMA MDD process to develop applications of the tele-operation domain are analyzed in terms of code generation. © J.UCS."

To benefit from these advantages in the domain of embedded systems, the same concepts can be used, but a different implementation strategy is required: monolithic application servers are not suitable because of the limited resources regarding computing power, memory, etc. on the device. An alternative can be based on using a family of codegenerated containers. The container is generated from models that specify interfaces, components, system topologies and deployments. In addition to motivating the problem and looking at related work, this paper gives general guidelines for the design and implementation of such infrastructures and describes a prototype implementation that has been implemented recently.

As one of the promising software development approaches, model-driven development (MDD) aims to change the focus of software development from code to models. This paradigm shift, introduced by the MDD, may also provide the desired abstraction level during the development of MASs. For this reason, MDD of autonomous agents and MASs has been recognized and become one of the research topics in agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) area. Contributions are mainly based on the model-driven architecture (MDA), which is the most famous and in-use realization of MDD. Within this direction, AOSE researchers define MAS metamodels in various abstraction levels and apply model transformations between the instances of these metamodels in order to provide rapid and efficient implementation of the MASs in various platforms. Reorganization of the existing MAS development methodologies to support model-driven agent development is another emerging research track. In this paper, we give a state of the art survey on above mentioned model-driven MAS development research activities and evaluate the introduced approaches according to five quality criteria we define on model-driven MAS engineering: (1) definition of a platform independent MAS metamodel, (2) model-to-model transformability, (3) model-to-code transformability, (4) support for multiple MAS platforms and finally (5) tool support for software modeling and code generation. Our evaluation has shown that the researchers contributed to the area by providing MDD processes in which design of the MASs are realized at a very high abstraction level and the software for these MASs are developed as a result of the application of a series of model transformations. However, most of the approaches are incapable of supporting multiple MAS environments due to the restricted specifications of their metamodels and model transformations. Also efficiency and practicability of the proposed methodologies are under debate since the amount and quality of the executable MAS components, gained automatically, appear to be not sufficient.

The central idea is to develop a safety architecture that provides the basis for risk assessment and visualization within a safety case, the formal justification of acceptable safety required by the aviation regulatory authority. A safety architecture is composed from a collection of bow tie diagrams (BTDs), a practical approach to manage safety risk by linking the identified hazards to the appropriate mitigation measures. The safety justification for a given unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operation can have many related BTDs. In practice, however, each BTD is independently developed, which poses challenges with respect to incremental development, maintaining consistency across different safety artifacts when changes occur, and in extracting and presenting stakeholder specific information relevant for decision making. We show how a safety architecture reconciles the various BTDs of a system, and, collectively, provide an overarching picture of system safety, by considering them as views of a unified model. We also show how it enables model-driven development of BTDs, replete with validations, transformations, and a range of views. Our approach, which we have implemented in our toolset, AdvoCATE, is illustrated with a running example drawn from a real UAS safety case. The models and some of the innovations described here were instrumental in successfully obtaining regulatory flight approval."

Increasingly they are deployed in complex scenarios and must be able to adapt to changing environments and internal system changes. Such self-adaptive embedded systems pose great advantages in terms of flexibility, resource utilization, energy efficiency and robustness. The realization of these systems require enhanced development methods to incorporate the adaptation in the design. We introduce a novel concept for the model-driven development of self-adaptive embedded systems. The focus of our work is the definition and transfer of the information needed for the adaptation at runtime. This is preserved as so-called self-description of the components. We present our self-x profile, a modeling extension for describing the adaptation, and the respective design flow with built-in transformations. Furthermore, we outline the applicability of our methodology in an automotive use case. © 2011 IEEE."

For a distributed system of autonomous components like Web services, especially when they are used for implementing business processes, transactional guarantees can be of vital importance. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach which introduces a separate design layer dedicated to transactions. We show that our systematic modeling approach is able to introduce transactions in the design without increasing the complexity of the basic UML diagram. Our approach can also be reused to specify other properties of Web services such as security requirements or workflows in additional layers."

Among many approaches to this subject, real-time control loops have imposed themselves due to the direct mapping of their components onto the components of the generic autonomic computing architecture. In this paper we explore the Model-Driven Approach to the development of real-time architecture for autonomic computing for a self-optimization scenario. This leads to the synthesis of a Platform Independent Model (PIM) for generic autonomic computing systems and a Platform Specific Model (PMS) for a specific application of it. Both the PIM and the PMS are then detailed up to the implementation level. The Platform Specific Model was considered for a Web Service based implementation of the PIM. © 2008 IEEE."

A self-Adaptive system typically consists of a managed subsystem and a managing subsystem that implements the adaptation logic by means of the well established MAPE-K control loop. Since in large distributed settings centralized control is hardly adequate to manage the whole system, self-Adaptation should be achieved through collective decentralized control, that is multiple cyber-physical entities must adapt in order to address critical runtime conditions. Developing such systems is challenging, as several dimensions concerning both the cyber-physical system and the decentralized control loop should be considered. To this end, we promote MAPE-K components as first-class modeling abstractions and provide a framework supporting the design, development, and validation of decentralized self-Adaptive cyber-physical systems."

When access to software applications must be guaranteed in more than one context of use, it is necessary to adapt these user interfaces in order to preserve their usability when the switch between contexts occur. For this purpose, this paper proposes a model and a presentation technique to express and manipulate the plasticity domain of a user interface. The plasticity domain denotes the set of contexts of use it is able to cover while preserving its usability. In this paper, we focus on one aspect of the context of use: the platform screen size. A window requires a graphical area for its rendering and manipulation by the enduser. The model supports the definition of this graphical area in terms of window size and window place. The visualization technique helps in both making observable the set of presentations that fit the available space, and perceiving which operations could help in switching from one presentation to another one. The first benefit is powerful for eliciting the candidate presentations when the context of use changes.

The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models and adaptation activities, runtime megamodels have been proposed. A runtime megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable modeling language for ExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels (EUREMA) that eases the development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution. © 2014 ACM."

Its use normally improves the quality of the developed systems in terms of productivity, portability, inter-operability and maintenance. Therefore, its exploitation for the development of multi-agent systems (MAS) emerges in a natural way. In this paper, agent-oriented software development (AOSD) and MDE paradigms are fully integrated for the development of MAS. Meta-modeling techniques are explicitly used to speed up several phases of the process. The Prometheus methodology is used for the purpose of validating the proposal. The meta-object facility (MOF) architecture is used as a guideline for developing a MAS editor according to the language provided by Prometheus methodology. Firstly, an Ecore meta-model for Prometheus language is developed. Ecore is a powerful tool for designing model-driven architectures (MDA). Next, facilities provided by the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) are used to generate the graphical editor. It offers support to develop agent models conform to the meta-model specified. Afterwards, it is also described how an agent code generator can be developed. In this way, code is automatically generated using as input the model specified with the graphical editor. A case of study validates the method put in practice for the development of a multi-agent surveillance system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Searching such a high-dimensional state space makes it difficult to recognize, track, and manipulate deformable objects. In this paper, we introduce a predictive, model-driven approach to address this challenge, using a precomputed, simulated database of deformable object models. Mesh models of common deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in multiple different poses under gravity, and stored in a database for fast and efficient retrieval. To validate this approach, we developed a comprehensive pipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task. First, the database is used for category and the pose estimation is used for a garment in an arbitrary position. A fully featured 3-D model of the garment is constructed in real time, and volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the database to predict the object category and pose. Second, the database can significantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via nonrigid registration, providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed object model and the database models. Third, the accurate model simulation can also be used to optimize the trajectories for the manipulation of deformable objects, such as the folding of garments. Extensive experimental results are shown for the above tasks using a variety of different clothings. Note to Practitioners - This paper provides an open source, extensible, 3-D database for dissemination to the robotics and graphics communities. Model-driven methods are proliferating, and they need to be applied, tested, and validated in real environments. A key idea we have exploited is to have an innovative and novel use of simulation. This database will serve as infrastructure for developing advanced robotic machine learning algorithms. We want to address this machine learning idea ourselves, but we expect the dissemination of the database to other researchers with different agendas and task applications, which will bring wide progress in this area. Our proposed methods, as mentioned earlier, can be easily applied to interrelated areas. One example is that the 3-D shape-based matching algorithm can be used for other objects, such as bottles, papers, and food. After integrating with other robotic systems, the use of the robot can be easily extended to other tasks, such as making food, cleaning room, and fetching objects, to assist our daily life."

We start by reviewing the Android scaffolding for producing flexible GUIs for mobile devices. The latter can present rather different displays, in terms of size, orientation and resolution. Then we show how our model-based generative technique allows producing prototypes that match both the Android GUIs requirements, while implementing our model-driven approach for user navigation.

Although therapy robots have a strong potential in dealing with therapeutic and other medical applications, they have not been fully utilized in everyday therapy activities due to concerns over safety and the lack of friendly robot user/patient interaction models. From the viewpoint of software engineering, a user-centred design based on UML (Unified Modelling Language) has been known to be one of the best solutions to satisfy usability since the design process relies heavily on the analysis of users and their tasks to reach their goals. Therefore, a model-driven approach to interactive system design via UML for therapy robots is needed to make them usable in the real world. This paper proposes such approach and introduces a new graphical notation that describes user interface elements and the methods of connection with hardware/software objects. With the proposed abstract interaction models, prototyping interactive systems can be made faster and allows for their evaluation by users and system developers before implementation in order to improve usability from the perspectives of users and system developers."

If those requirements change during runtime, the application should change the SLAM implementation. Implementing the selection of the optimal SLAM-Algorithms for robots by hand is time consuming and leads to bad code maintainability by mixing application and adaptation logic. Moreover, the realization of the optimization in code requires the developer to re-implement parts of general purpose optimizers, which impairs reusability. An external adaptation logic selecting the optimal SLAM algorithm addresses the maintainability and programmability issues. A model-driven approach for both, application and selection problem, highly increases reusability. To reach these goals, we propose to use Multi-Quality Auto-Tuning (MQuAT), a model-driven approach to build and operate self-optimizing systems following the Models@run.time paradigm. We evaluate our approach by a case study, where robots have to choose between several variants of a distributed SLAM algorithm."

As the availability and quality of the sensed data changes, the underlying models and decision algorithms should continually adapt in order to meet desired high-level requirements. Due to the complexity of such dynamic data-driven systems, traditional design time techniques are often incapable of producing a solution that remains optimal in the face of dynamically changing data, algorithms, and even availability of computational resources. To assist developers of these systems, we present a modeling and optimization methodology that enables developers to capture application task flows and data sources, define associated quality metrics with data types, specify each algorithm's data and quality requirements, and define a data quality estimation framework to optimize the application at runtime. We demonstrate each facet of the modeling and optimization process via a video-based vehicle tracking and collision avoidance application, and show how such an approach results in efficient design space exploration when selecting the optimal set of algorithm modalities. When searching for an application configuration within 1% to 5% of optimal, our model-guided approach can achieve speedups of up to 9.3X versus a standard genetic algorithm and speedups of up to 80X relative to a brute force algorithm."

The formation of metastable aggregates often hampers self-assembly of molecular building blocks into the desired nanostructures. Strategies are explored to master the pathway complexity and avoid off-pathway aggregates by optimizing the rate of assembly along the correct pathway. We study as a model system the coassembly of two monomers, the R- and S-chiral enantiomers of a π-conjugated oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) derivative. Coassembly kinetics are analyzed by developing a kinetic model, which reveals the initial assembly of metastable structures buffering free monomers and thereby slows the formation of thermodynamically stable assemblies. These metastable assemblies exert greater influence on the thermodynamically favored self-assembly pathway if the ratio between both monomers approaches 1:1, in agreement with experimental results. Moreover, competition by metastable assemblies is highly temperature dependent and hampers the assembly of equilibrium nanostructures most effectively at intermediate temperatures. We demonstrate that the rate of the assembly process may be optimized by tuning the cooling rate. Finally, it is shown by simulation that increasing the driving force for assembly stepwise by changing the solvent composition may circumvent metastable pathways and thereby force the assembly process directly into the correct pathway."

The purposive deployment of mission sensors carried by several unmanned aerial vehicles (multi–UAV) in such missions brings in new and impactful aspects, specifically in workload-intensive situations. An associate system offering variable automation levels supports the HC’s crew by deploying machine-executable functionalities and high-level capabilities.

This paper introduces a model-driven approach to automatically predict and describe the QoS of composite web services specified by use of the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services. The paper is founded on a lightweight QoS-oriented extension of the WSDL and specifically addresses the QoS in terms of the performability attribute, which defines a combined measure of performance and reliability. The proposed approach is illustrated by use of an example application that shows how the performability analysis may lead to predictions that do not correspond to those obtained by approaches that only consider the performance attribute. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

When considering systems of systems within the autonomous defence systems context, these aspects become increasingly critical, as constraints on the performance of the final system are typically driven by hard constraints on space, weight and power. System execution modelling languages and tools permit early prediction of the performance of model-driven systems; however, the focus to date has been on understanding the performance of a model rather than determining whether it meets performance requirements, and only subsequently carrying out analysis to reveal the causes of any requirement violations. Moreover, such an analysis is even more difficult when applied to several systems cooperating to achieve a common goal—a system of systems.

The methodology includes CS learning variability modelling using the feature-based approaches borrowed from the SW engineering domain. Firstly, we define the CS learning domain using the known educational framework TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy And Content Knowledge). By learning variability we mean the attributes of the framework extracted and represented as feature models with multiple values. Therefore, the CS learning variability represents the problem domain. Meta-programming is considered as a solution domain. Both are represented by feature models. The GLO design task is formulated as mapping the problem domain model on the solution domain model. Next, we present the design framework to design GLOs manually or semi-automatically. The multi-level separation of concepts, model representation and transformation forms the conceptual background. Its theoretical background includes: (a) a formal definition of feature-based models; (b) a graph-based and set-based definition of meta-programming concepts; (c) transformation rules to support the model mapping; (d) a computational Abstract State Machine model to define the processes and design tool for developing GLOs. We present the architecture and some characteristics of the tool. The tool enables to improve the GLO design process significantly (in terms of time and quality) and to achieve a higher quality and functionality of GLOs themselves (in terms of the parameter space enlargement for reuse and adaptation). We demonstrate the appropriateness of the methodology in the real teaching setting. In this paper, we present the case study that analyses three robot-oriented GLOs as the higher-level specifications. Then, using the meta-language processor, we are able to produce, from the specifications, the concrete robot control programs on demand automatically and to demonstrate teaching algorithms visually by robot's actions. We evaluate the approach from technological and pedagogical perspectives using the known structural metrics. Also, we indicate the merits and demerits of the approach. The main contribution and originality of the paper is the seamless integration of two known technologies (feature modelling and meta-programming) in designing robot-oriented GLOs and their supporting tools."

An intensive analysis of the application requirements simplified the process of modelling the application's behavioural model, therefore, instead of modelling several variation models, the developers modelled an extra-functionality model. COCA-MDA reduces the development effort because it maintains a clear separation of concerns and employs a decomposition mechanism to produce a context-oriented component model which decouples the applications' core functionality from the context-dependent functionality. Estimating the MDA approach's productivity can help the software developers to select the best MDA-based methodology from the available solutions proposed in the literature. Thus, counting the source line of code is not adequate for evaluating the development effort of the MDA-based methodology. Quantifying the maintenance adjustment factor of the new, adapted, and reused code is a better estimate of the development effort of the MDA approaches. © 2011 IEEE."

A web service is a self-describing, open component that supports rapid composition of distributed applications. Web service definitions are used to describe the service capabilities in terms of the operations of the service and the input and output messages for each operation. Such definitions are expressed in XML by use of the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL). Unfortunately, a WSDL description only addresses the functional aspects of a web service without containing any useful description of non functional or quality of service (QoS) characteristics. This paper introduces a lightweight WSDL extension for the description of QoS characteristics of a web service. The extension is carried out as a metamodel transformation, according to principles and standards recommended by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The WSDL metamodel is introduced and then transformed into the Q-WSDL (QoS-enabled WSDL) metamodel. As an example application of Q-WSDL, the paper illustrates a model-driven method that exploits Q-WSDL in order to automatically predict and describe the QoS of systems based on composite web services specified by use of the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL). The paper specifically addresses the prediction of the reliability attribute of QoS and is illustrated by use of an example application to a composite web service for travel planning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010."

In particular, the lack of coordination between control devices and fast change in PV generation can cause voltage magnitude to go beyond limits. This study addresses the issue by providing a novel real-time centralised voltage control algorithm to tackle voltage fluctuations caused by variability of PV power generation. The new method considers autonomous response of upstream voltage regulation devices and provides optimised set-points for the chosen downstream controllers. Furthermore, the investigated method was tested in the real-time digital simulator on a model of 11 kV grid located in a semi-rural area of Queensland, Australia. The control algorithm was designed in MATLAB with a multidimensional, non-linear, mixed-integer optimisation. The parallel computing implementation of the KNITRO optimiser helped to provide quicker and more accurate response than the existing uncoordinated control schemes. As a result, optimised control coordination leads to a substantial reduction in voltage fluctuations and decrease in regulation time. Moreover, the proposed method detects and eliminates unnecessary control operations. Thus, it can also prevent voltage hunting in distribution networks."

Since they are semantically self-contained, and thus executable, they offer a more compact and easy-to-understand approach to test specification than code-level representations of tests. Nevertheless, since they still define tests at a relatively low-level of detail, they can be difficult to develop, and can become quite complex when describing large testing scenarios. Model driven testing approaches on the other hand support high level, graphical views of tests and provide methodological support for deriving tests from system models. However, they invariably rely on code to describe executable versions of tests, and tend to depict the different ingredients of tests in separated, isolated views. The development of test sheets is therefore likely to be significantly simplified by the support of a suitable model-driven testing approach, while model driven testing approaches are likely to be enhanced by the availability of compact, executable representations of tests in the form of tests sheets. In this chapter we therefore explore the synergy between test sheets and model-driven development in the context of the test stories methodology. This is an advanced standards-compliant method that covers the whole test development process from abstract requirements to concrete executable tests, but in the context of programming languages as implementation vehicles.

Hence, traffic data collection platforms are proposed to collect GPS data points for traffic monitoring. In traffic data collection platforms, each vehicle equips with GPS modules and the wireless communication interfaces, such as 3G or WiFi networks, and the GPS data sensed (e.g., the speed and the position) are sent to the server. One challenge issue is that if a significant number of vehicles upload their GPS data points at the same time, it is possible that the wireless network cannot offer enough network resources for simultaneous network connections. This paper proposes a framework MDC (standing for Model-based Data Collection) to reduce the amount of data transmission and the number of vehicles reporting their GPS data points. The MDC framework is executed at the server and vehicle side collaboratively. In the vehicle side, given a series of GPS data points, model functions are derived to represent the raw GPS data points. Hence, each vehicle could report some coefficients that describe its movements instead of reporting all position information. Since vehicles move along with road segments that are usually a set of line segments, algorithm LR (standing for Liner Regression) is proposed to determine a set of line functions to represent movements of vehicles. By observing the spatial-temporal locality in traffic data, algorithm KR (standing for Kernel Regression) is developed to derive a set of kernel functions to model a series of speed readings sensed. Moreover, with the spatial-temporal locality feature in traffic data, an in-network aggregation mechanism are proposed to determine a set of groups and for each group, only one vehicle needs to report traffic data, thereby further reducing the number of simultaneous connections. Experimental results show that MDC can collect traffic data effectively and the efficiently. © 2010 IEEE."

The modeling tool creates high quality 3D models by facilitating constrained modifications to a generic model of the object class. Secondly, the dynamic object is tracked in the video sequence and the pose of the object is recorded. The tracking and pose estimation leverage the 3D model to ensure high accuracy. Lastly, the surrounding scene is modeled as a texturedpiece-wise planar approximation. A free-viewpoint rendering of the video (4D video) is then produced as needed for special effects or virtual reality applications. The versatility and effectiveness of our approach to modeling and rendering is demonstrated on the object class of vehicles. © 2006 IEEE."

These virtual execution platforms allow the execution of embedded software with strict consideration of the underlying hardware platform configuration in order to reduce subsequent development costs and to allow a short time-to-market by tailoring and exploring distributed embedded hardware and software architectures. Starting from abstract UML-based descriptions of the software and hardware architecture as well as integrated abstractions of legacy code, model transformation techniques are used during the model-driven generation process. The combination of source code level timing and power annotations obtained from binary legacy code analysis with a layered approach for TLM-based simulation of non-functional properties in a common virtual prototyping methodology allows a fast and accurate simulation of the embedded system model. We further show the synchronization and co-simulation of the embedded hardware/software with vehicle dynamics including human-in-the-loop.

In this paper, modeling and automation approaches for a hydraulic mini excavator are developed. In particular, a physical model for detailed system analysis and a simplified Hammerstein model for controller tuning are developed and validated with measurement data from the mini excavator. For attitude estimation of the excavator, inertial measurement units and extended Kalman filters are used in a sensor fusion framework. The control concept for automation is based on a virtual driver consisting of a state machine for task coordination as well as offset-free model predictive controllers (MPCs) for decentralized and robust tracking control of all motion axes. The constrained MPC optimization problems are solved in real time by means of the accelerated proximal gradient method. Experimental results from the mini excavator prove the developed control approach to be valuable for virtual development and automated testing during the commissioning of hydraulic machinery.Note to Practitioners - In this paper, a hydraulic mini excavator is considered for demonstrating the benefits of automation with regard to the development of advanced mobile machinery. A detailed physical model and a simplified model are introduced for virtual analysis and comissioning of the excavator. This allows for detailed system analysis even at an early development stage. Then, a framework for automated testing of the real prototype is introduced. This concept is based on attitude estimation filters, a state machine, and model predictive controllers and closely resembles the human driver in its behavior, but allows for reproducible testing results and therefore reduces commissioning efforts and development costs. Particular attention is paid to the robustness of the control concept, since the coupling of the hydraulic axes and digging forces lead to disturbances that need to be compensated. A simple, yet efficient and real-time capable algorithm is provided for numerical optimization. Experimental results show that the developed methods can contribute to the automation of hydraulic machinery, and that the introduced framework can easily be extended in order to automate other types of machinery with simple hydraulics."

Simulations show that the traffic congestion is indeed affected by the concerned factors; however, the traffic congestion fails to be mitigated persistently as the communication radius increases beyond a certain threshold. The result is helpful for understanding the traffic congestion propagation in connected vehicles."

However, most dependability cases are written with a single product in mind. At the same time, software product lines (families of related software products) have been studied with the goal of modeling variability and commonality, and building family based techniques for both analysis and testing. However, there has been little work on building an end to end dependability case for a software product line (where a property is modeled, a counter example is found and then validated as a true positive via testing), and none that we know of in an emerging safety-critical domain, that of robotic surgery. In this paper, we study a family of surgical robots, that combine hardware and software, and are highly configurable, representing over 1300 unique robots. At the same time, they are considered safety-critical and should have associated dependability cases. We perform a case study to understand how we can bring together lightweight formal analysis, feature modeling, and testing to provide an end to end pipeline to find potential violations of important safety properties. In the process, we learned that there are some interesting and open challenges for the research community, which if solved will lead towards more dependable safety-critical cyber-physical systems."

We develop an analytic framework for such cancelation in sensory neurons produced by a cerebellar-like structure in wave-type electric fish. Our biologically plausible mechanism is motivated by experimental evidence of cancelation of periodic input arising from the proximity of conspecifics as well as tail motion. This mechanism involves elements present in a wide range of systems: (1) stimulus-driven feedback to the neurons acting as detectors, (2) a large variety of temporal delays in the pathways transmitting such feedback, responsible for producing frequency channels, and (3) burst-induced long-term plasticity. The bursting arises from back-propagating action potentials. Bursting events drive the input frequency-dependent learning rule, which in turn affects the feedback input and thus the burst rate. We show how the mean firing rate and the rate of production of 2- and 4-spike bursts (the main learning events) can be estimated analytically for a leaky integrate-and-fire model driven by (slow) sinusoidal, back-propagating and feedback inputs as well as rectified filtered noise. The effect of bursts on the average synaptic strength is also derived. Our results shed light on why bursts rather than single spikes can drive learning in such networks ""online"", i.e. in the absence of a correlative discharge. Phase locked spiking in frequency specific channels together with a frequency-dependent STDP window size regulate burst probability and duration self-consistently to implement cancelation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Background: Parent drivers frequently engage in child-related secondary behaviors, but the impact on driving performance is unknown. Applying automated speech-processing techniques to NDS audio data would facilitate the analysis of in-vehicle driver-child interactions and their influence on driving performance. Method: Speech activity detection and speaker diarization algorithms were applied to audio data from a Melbourne-based NDS involving 42 families. Multilevel models were developed to evaluate the effect of speech activity and the presence of child passengers on driving performance. Results: Speech activity was significantly associated with velocity and steering angle variability. Child passenger presence alone was not associated with changes in driving performance. However, speech activity in the presence of two child passengers was associated with the most variability in driving performance. Conclusion: The effects of in-vehicle speech on driving performance in the presence of child passengers appear to be heterogeneous, and multiple factors may need to be considered in evaluating their impact. This goal can potentially be achieved within large-scale NDS through the automated processing of observational data, including speech. Application: Speech-processing algorithms enable new perspectives on driving performance to be gained from existing NDS data, and variables that were once labor-intensive to process can be readily utilized in future research."

Accurately predicting human actions in the real world is essential for targeted recommendations that could improve our health and for personalization of these applications. However, making such predictions is extremely difficult due to the complexities of human behavior, which consists of a large number of potential actions that vary over time, depend on each other, and are periodic. Previous work has not jointly modeled these dynamics and has largely focused on item consumption patterns instead of broader types of behaviors such as eating, commuting or exercising. In this work, we develop a novel statistical model, called TIPAS, for Time-varying, Interdependent, and Periodic Action Sequences. Our approach is based on personalized, multivariate temporal point processes that model time-varying action propensities through a mixture of Gaussian intensities. Our model captures short-term and long-term periodic interdependencies between actions through Hawkes process-based self-excitations. We evaluate our approach on two activity logging datasets comprising 12 million real-world actions (e.g., eating, sleep, and exercise) taken by 20 thousand users over 17 months. We demonstrate that our approach allows us to make successful predictions of future user actions and their timing. Specifically, TIPAS improves predictions of actions, and their timing, over existing methods across multiple datasets by up to 156%, and up to 37%, respectively. Performance improvements are particularly large for relatively rare and periodic actions such as walking and biking, improving over baselines by up to 256%. This demonstrates that explicit modeling of dependencies and periodicities in real-world behavior enables successful predictions of future actions, with implications for modeling human behavior, app personalization, and targeting of health interventions."

Thus, application adaptation decisions not only depend on context properties, but also on service availability and QoS-properties. In this chapter we present a novel comprehensive modeling approach that facilitates the model-driven development of such applications. Our focus is on modeling concepts which align the description of services and their QoS-properties with the context modeling approach.

In this domain we analyze the control architectures of representative example systems to identify common abstractions. It turns out that the introduced notion of motion primitives implemented as dynamical systems with machine learning capabilities, provide the computational building block for a large class of such control architectures.

Using a proper tool chain, we show how to employ this model-driven approach in a case study for the real world example of automatic laundry grasping with the KUKA LWR-IV, where executable source-code is automatically generated from the domain-specific language specification."

We address these challenges by providing explications of organizational structures through modeling. In this paper we present a service-oriented perspective on the organizational structure of MAS and we present modeling techniques and tools for supporting this perspective. We pursue a model-driven approach and a tight integration between various models on the one hand and between the models and the generated code on the other hand. In particular, we use ontologies to define a meta-model for organizational structures in a way that we can easily generate the initial content of agent knowledge bases in the form of FIPA semantic language (SL) fragments, depending on the positions the agents occupy in the context of the organizational structure. This allows the agents to reason and to communicate about their organizational embedding, which is a prerequisite for self-adaptation in multi-agent systems."

The second approach is based on a Generalized Regression Neural Network model to implicitly establish the same relationship. We further compare the two proposed models with three well-recognized existing models: vehicle specific power (VSP) model, Virginia Tech microscopic (VT-Micro) model, and Comprehensive Modal Emission Model (CMEM). According to our validations at both microscopic and macroscopic levels, the two proposed models have stronger performed in predicting fuel consumption in new routes. The models can be used to design more energy-efficient driving behaviors in the soon-to-come era of connected and automated vehicles."

Most applications are intertwined with and tied to fixed robots and worlds. Changes and evolution of a robot or world have an invasive and often unpredictable impact on the application software. We propose making the models of robots and worlds explicit in robotics applications and separate these by introducing application-specific and platform-independent interfaces. This separation allows modular model-driven development of robotics applications and enables the reuse and adaptation of models and applications without need for invasive modifications. We present a framework with a family of modeling languages for conceptual, platform-independent applications, tasks, robots, and worlds. The model-driven RoboTask framework integrates these languages with a runtime architecture to execute robotics tasks using a planner and mappings from conceptual models to actual platforms. This enables a separation of domain concerns from software development concerns and modification of applications without invasive impacts on their separated constituents. We believe that the enabled reuse and adaptation lead to more efficient development and higher quality software for robotics applications."

In this context, technology has become one of the key factors to achieve sustainability goals. An example of these technologies are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which are being used more and more with sustainability purposes. However, although some efforts have been made to propose software approaches to model sustainability, some examples that model the impact of technology on sustainability are still needed.

However, the increasingly complex nature of these neural networks means that they are particularly suited for server computers with powerful GPUs. We envision that deep learning applications will be eventually and widely deployed on mobile devices, e.g., smartphones, self-driving cars, and drones. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to understand the resource requirements (time, memory) of CNNs on mobile devices. First, by deploying several popular CNNs on mobile CPUs and GPUs, we measure and analyze the performance and resource usage for every layer of the CNNs. Our findings point out the potential ways of optimizing the performance on mobile devices. Second, we model the resource requirements of the different CNN computations. Finally, based on the measurement, profiling, and modeling, we build and evaluate our modeling tool, Augur, which takes a CNN configuration (descriptor) as the input and estimates the compute time and resource usage of the CNN, to give insights about whether and how efficiently a CNN can be run on a given mobile platform. In doing so Augur tackles several challenges: (i) how to overcome profiling and measurement overhead; (ii) how to capture the variance in different mobile platforms with different processors, memory, and cache sizes; and (iii) how to account for the variance in the number, type and size of layers of the different CNN configurations."

Therefore, a trajectory decision model is an essential component of a complete driver model. In this paper, we propose a trajectory decision model that is suitable for complicated mountain roads and racing circuits. We first present a computational strategy of ""point selection in a preview cross-section,"" and establish four objective functions corresponding to four typical driving patterns (direction control patterns/habits) that could be applied to a mountain road. Subsequently, inequality constraints are set based on the practical driving features. While referring to the decision-making processes for determining a target trajectory in the real world, a rolling-horizon algorithm is proposed for trajectory decision simulation for a mountain road of an arbitrarily complicated alignment, which is also of an arbitrary length. Simulation examples for the trajectory decision for two mountain highways and one Formula 1 circuit are presented at the end of the paper. The simulation results show that the simulated trajectories produced by the proposed models conform to our expectations and are consistent with the trajectories observed in actual driving. Moreover, the decision model for the target trajectory, along with a previously developed trajectory tracking model, can be combined into an improved driver model with a more complete structure: that is, a ""preview - decision - tracking"" direction control model."

However, manually creating software that predicts user intentions is complex, error-prone and expensive. Model-based development can help in overcoming these issues. In this paper, we present an approach for modeling a user's intention based on Bayesian networks. We support developers of in-car infotainment systems by providing means to model possible intentions of users according to the current situation. We further allow modeling of user preferences and show how the modeled intentions may change during run-time as a result of the user's behavior. We demonstrate feasibility of our approach using an industrial example of an intention-aware in-car infotainment system."

We use Position Discrepancy (PD) to model this lack of spatial coherence in MICE. Based on that, we propose a Hierarchical Position Discrepancy Model (HPDM) that computes PD at multiple levels to derive the application/system-level PD as a measure of performance. Experimental results on an example task in MICE show that HPDM can objectively quantify the application performance and has a correlation to the psychometric study-based QoE measurements.

Large power ripple caused by the current commutation is a challenge issue for SRM drives, which would lower the system efficiency, requires extra heat dissipation in the battery and shortens its lifetime. The detailed model of the SRM drive and IMPC is developed which covers both motoring and generating modes of operation. Based on this model, an advanced multiobjective power flow control method with repetitive controller is proposed to restrain battery current ripple. Because of the unified model, a seamless transition between various modes can also be achieved. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed control method."

However, the limited electric range of PEVs could impede their market introduction. Still some potential users are willing to pay more for PEVs. The combined effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are unclear. Here, we study the market evolution of PEVs in Germany until 2020. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of PEVs due to external conditions and the users' willingness to pay. We find the future share of PEVs in German passenger car stock to range from 0.4% to almost 3% by 2020. Energy prices have a large impact on PEV market evolution as a 25% increase in fuel prices would double the number of PEVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a special depreciation allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1000. Euro as the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. The high uncertainty of the market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of PEVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions."

This process results in a theory, which is represented by a cluster of models that jointly produce robust solutions. The multiplicity of models is imposed not only by the complexity of systems, but also by the need to constrain abstractions to a limited number of variables. Motivated by these observations, we propose a methodological foundation that views systems science from the lens of cognitive models of scientific discovery, allowing the management of ensemble of models while supporting autonomous mediation of theory with data."

Orchestration is a strongly supported mechanism which enables integration of component Web services into executable workflow processes. It uses XML based WS-BPEL language as a de-facto standard. This article inspects possible interaction patterns that are offered by WS-BPEL language and inspects different proposals for the development of WS-BPEL models. Most of them are based on model driven development where workflows are specified using languages with visual annotation or with higher level of abstraction which enable easier development or formal checking. Those models are afterwards automatically or semi-automatically translated into abstract and latter into executable WS-BPEL models. © 2012 MIPRO."

However, in the emerging areas of automated driving and human-robot collaboration, the dynamic management of system and environmental objects is mandatory. For this, object-oriented concepts are required in addition to the established modeling concepts. This paper demonstrates the application of signal-flow diagrams together with object-oriented models in Modern C++ for the software development in the area of submicroscopic traffic control. Both the vehicle dynamics and the longitudinal controllers are modeled as signal-flow diagrams and state-space models. Above this control layer, the dynamic creation and removal of individual vehicles and environmental objects are modeled in Modern C++. Together with Boost odeint these models are directly represented on a high abstraction level.

It contains several modules such as the traction control unit or the central control unit, as well as input and output stations, such as driver's cab terminals and process I/Os. A plethora of devices are connected to the vehicle and train bus and are able to communicate. The functions of the vehicle control and traction systems are configured by using function blocks from which loadable programs are generated. The languages used to program the control units are well established in the field. However, one-size-fits-all approach cannot adequately address the increased complexity of the software in modern trains. In this paper we describe our preliminary experience with using the multi-paradigm modeling tool 'mbeddr' in the railway domain. The following aspects have been in focus during the work: a) matching the application requirements and domain specific language used for implementation; b) integration of model-based approach into traditional product lifecycle; c) reengineering existing functionality using modeling and code generation capabilities of mbeddr. The system example we chose was the application logic of automated train driving system implemented in development environment of Siemens process automation framework."

In this paper, a modified internal model controller (MIMC) for the speed regulation of the drive part with elastic joints in robotic system is proposed, where control structure is composed of an internal model controller (IMC) and a feedback controller. In order to improve the performance of the motor speed, the parameters of controller are set based on the rule that the settle time is shorter and vibration can be efficiently suppressed. The experiment on the two-mass test platform with one motor speed transducer has been done to verify effectiveness of the proposed control scheme."

To expand test capabilities for odometry and assistant applications, test drives are represented in a modular co-simulation and based on domain specific simulation programs. In order to map the complex structures of the test set-up, the basic architecture of rail transport is simulated in functional modules with standardized interfaces. The railway mechanics are modelled in Multibody Simulation (MBS), with their vehicle components and sensors as modules in MATLAB/Simulink. Scenario control is implemented by a functional ETCS (European Train Control System) infrastructure with control center, interlocking block, radio block center and on-board unit. Change of route by changing a switch is handled with an automatic track generator and restarting simulation at current position. 3D repositioning is achieved by a virtual milestone approach. The vehicle sensors of the scientific test set-up are included as sensor modules. The GNSS sensor module is functionally modelled as space segment and user segment. For each sensor module a sensor-error module with possible activation of specified fault state can be used by analyzing algorithm robustness. The co-simulation is used as the development platform for odometry algorithms as well as vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure investigations. The presented co-simulation and models are validated by measurements of the reference rail vehicle ""IFS-Erprobungsträger 1"". Test runs can be traced in the simulation and enriched by additional or intentionally defective simulated sensor signals.

Hence, the spatial and temporal requirements play an essential role for their correct and safe execution. Furthermore, the local interactions among the system components result in global spatio-temporal emergent behaviors often impossible to predict at the design time. In this work, we pursue a complementary approach by introducing STREL a novel spatio-temporal logic that enables the specification of spatio-temporal requirements and their monitoring over the execution of mobile and spatially distributed CPS. Our logic extends the Signal Temporal Logic [15] with two novel spatial operators reach and escape from which is possible to derive other spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround. These operators enable a monitoring procedure where the satisfaction of the property at each location depends only on the satisfaction of its neighbours, opening the way to future distributed online monitoring algorithms. We propose both a qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint semirings, an algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and optimisation. We prove that, for a subclass of models, all the spatial properties expressed with reach and escape, using euclidean distance, satisfy all the model transformations using rotation, reflection and translation. Finally, we provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and, to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we show its application using the monitoring of a simulated mobile ad-hoc sensor network as running example."

Antidepressants targeting monoamines directly affect the functional tone of these circuits, notably in limbic and frontocortical areas, and evidence has been provided that this action plays a key role in their therapeutic efficacy. Indeed, at least some of functional changes detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging in emotion- and cognitive-related circuits such as the one involving limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic connections in depressed patients can be reversed by monoamine-targeted antidepressants. However, antidepressants acting selectively on only one monoamine, such as selective inhibitors of 5-HT or NE reuptake, alleviate depression symptoms in a limited percentage of patients, and are poorly effective to prevent recurrence. Thorough investigations for the last 30years allowed the demonstration of the existence of functional interactions between 5-HT, NE and DA systems, and the identification of the specific receptors involved. In particular, 5-HT systems were shown to exert negative influence on NE and DA systems through 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor- mediated mechanisms, respectively. On the other hand, complex positive and negative influences of NE system on 5-HT neurotransmission are mediated through α[U+F061]1- and α[U+F061]2-adrenergic receptors, respectively. These data provided a rationale for the design of new, multimodal, therapeutic strategies involving drugs acting not only at the ""historical"" targets such as the 5-HT and/or the NE transporter, but also at other molecular targets to improve their efficacy and their tolerability. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

This article explores TMDCFET and BPFET SRAM design by combining atomistic self-consistent device modeling with SRAM circuit design and simulation. We perform detailed evaluations of the TMDCFET/BPFET SRAMs at a single bitcell and at SRAM array level. Our simulations show that at low operating voltages, TMDCFET/BPFET SRAMs exhibit significant advantages in static power, dynamic read/write noise margin, and read/write delay over nominal 16nm CMOS SRAMs at both bitcell and array-level implementations.

To alleviate this situation, we present a model-driven service MORE (Model-driven Operation seRvicE) to automate the initial deployment and the dynamic configuration of a system. Firstly, a model is proposed to specify the high-level view of a system in the form of a desired deployment topology. Then the topology model is transformed into executable code automatically, bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and low-level details. With those executable code as input, a runtime framework is designed based on a transaction-based selfconfiguration protocol to achieve automation and configuration consistency.

Monitoring live teleoperation video feeds, for example to search for survivors in search and rescue, can be cognitively taxing, particularly for operators driving multiple robots or monitoring multiple cameras. To reduce workload, emerging computer vision techniques can automatically identify and indicate (cue) salient points of potential interest for the operator. However, it is not clear how to cue such points to a preoccupied operator - whether cues would be distracting and a hindrance to operators - and how the design of the cue may impact operator cognitive load, attention drawn, and primary task performance. In this paper, we detail our iterative design process for creating a range of visual attention-grabbing cues that are grounded in psychological literature on human attention, and two formal evaluations that measure attention-grabbing capability and impact on operator performance. Our results show that visually cueing on-screen points of interest does not distract operators, that operators perform poorly without the cues, and detail how particular cue design parameters impact operator cognitive load and task performance. Specifically, full-screen cues can lower cognitive load, but can increase response time; animated cues may improve accuracy, but increase cognitive load. Finally, from this design process we provide tested, and theoretically grounded cues for attention drawing in teleoperation."

Yet even with advanced applications based on shared data standards, project professionals still face considerable difficulty accessing needed information in a form useful for decision making. In the authors' viewpoint, a primary reason for these difficulties is that most data and tools are designed and operated in the context of specific applications. This creates the problem of information tunnels: rich data and application areas with knowledge that is not easily transferable to other application areas. Information tunnels per se would not be a difficulty if projects had identical problems; walls between tunnels could be torn down or professionals could develop heuristic integration mechanisms that functioned with a high degree of reliability, speed, and accuracy. But each project faces unique challenges, making integration across tunnels difficult for both machines and humans. Hence, we envision information technologies that provide project professionals much greater configuration control in how they access project information, regardless of its source or tunnel. We believe user models will drive such technologies, formal structures that help capture and structure both the data and metadata that professionals use in their work. We describe a user model driven information architecture and compare how that environment might work in contrast to existing approaches."

We consider a problem setting without any dedicated hardware like GPS or a directional antenna that could assist navigation. The only information available are received signal strength indication measurements (RSSI) at the UAV. The following assumptions apply: (i) the wireless sensor node and the UAV are in mutual transmission range, (ii) the sensor node periodically sends a beacon message, (iii) the UAV transceiver is capable of measuring RSSI, and (iv) heading and movement of the UAV can be changed by our navigation algorithm. The presented algorithm creates a finite set of particles that corresponds to the possible headings of the mobile node. At each step that set is updated using current RSSI measurements and predefined weight functions. The heading of the mobile node in the current step is determined using the particle with the largest weight. The algorithm stops when the mobile node finds itself within a predefined range around the fixed sensor node, i.e. when the current RSSI measurement is higher than a threshold value. Simulation and experimental results show that our algorithm navigates the UAV towards the sensor node quickly and that it is robust against erratic RSSI values."

Despite the popularity of such approaches, existing exemplars provide application programming interfaces but no runtime model to develop adaptation engines. Consequently, there does not exist any exemplar that supports developing, evaluating, and comparing model-based self-adaptation off the shelf. Therefore, we present mRUBiS, an extensible exemplar for model-based architectural self-healing and self-optimization. mRUBiS simulates the adaptable software and therefore provides and maintains an architectural runtime model of the software, which can be directly used by adaptation engines to realize and perform self-adaptation. Particularly, mRUBiS supports injecting issues into the model, which should be handled by self-adaptation, and validating the model to assess the self-adaptation. Finally, mRUBiS allows developers to explore variants of adaptation engines (e.g., event-driven self-adaptation) and to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the engines."

A hierarchical solution approach is proposed where a coarse plan that satisfies the logic constraints is computed first at the higher-level, followed by a lower-level task of solving a sequence of multi-agent reachability problems. Collision avoidance and potential asynchronous executions are also dealt with at the lower-level. When lower-level planning problems are found to be infeasible, these infeasibility certificates are incorporated into the higher-level problem to re-generate plans. The results are demonstrated with several examples that show how the proposed approach scales with respect to different parameters."

However, a mobile service robot is constrained by the need to travel through the environment to reach a user in order to perform a service for them, as well as the need to carry out scheduled user requests. We present modified versions of Thompson Sampling and UCB1, existing algorithms used in multiarmed bandit problems, which plan ahead considering the time and location constraints of a mobile service robot.

A novel iterative multi-resolution path representation is used as a basis for the GA coding. The use of a multi-resolution path representation can reduce the expected search length for the path planning problem. If a successful path is found early in the search hierarchy (at a low level of resolution), then further expansion of that portion of the path search is not necessary. This advantage is mapped into the encoded search space and adjusts the string length accordingly. The algorithm is flexible; it handles multi-dimensional path planning problems, accommodates different optimization criteria and changes in these criteria, and it utilizes domain specific knowledge for making decisions. In the evolutionary path planner, the individual candidates are evaluated with respect to the workspace so that computation of the configuration space is not required. The algorithm can be applied for planning paths for mobile robots, assembly, piano-movers problems and articulated manipulators. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of multi-dimensional path planning problems."

However, MBD testing facilities can not provide a fully realistic verification environment compared to real test drives. Moreover, even road tests are limited, e.g., to reproduce driving situations and to test applications likely to cause property damage. Thus, this paper proposes to utilize driving simulators alongside MBD tools to achieve a fully virtual ADAS design and test environment. To put this idea in practice, the multi-level Vehicle Component Modeling and export (VCMX) framework is presented as the main contribution of this work. Finally, the combined tool support is evaluated by designing two ADAS from scratch so to highlight the advantages of utilizing VCMX especially in early prototyping stages of such applications."

By integrating both historical data analysis and simulations, a multi-scale approach is developed to evaluate the traffic safety and operational performance of large trucks on mountainous interstate highways in both scales of individual vehicle as well as traffic on the whole highway. A typical mountainous highway in Colorado is studied for demonstration purposes. Firstly, the ten-year historical accident records are analyzed to identify the accident-vulnerable-locations (AVLs) and site-specific critical adverse driving conditions. Secondly, simulation-based single-vehicle assessment is performed for different driving conditions at those AVLs along the whole corridor. Finally, the cellular-automaton (CA)-based simulation is carried out to evaluate the multi-vehicle traffic safety as well as the operational performance of the traffic by considering the actual speed limits, including the differential speed limits (DSL) at some locations. It is found that the multi-scale approach can provide insightful and comprehensive observations of the highway performance, which is especially important for mountainous highways. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

And optimal design of launch vehicles is a complex process which gathers a series of disciplines and possesses strong nonlinearity. Multidisciplinary design analysis (MDA) solves such problems by decomposing the problem into different disciplines and bringing in disciplinary analyzers.

The first step performs a single objective aerodynamic optimization and the second step involves a coupled dual objective aerodynamic and structural optimization. During the first step, airfoil geometry is optimized to get maximum endurance parameter at a 2D level with maximum thickness to chord ratio and maximum camber as design variables. Leading edge curvature, trailing edge radius, zero lift drag coefficient and zero lift moment coefficient are taken as constraints. Once the airfoil geometry is finalized, the wing planform parameters are optimized with minimization of wing weight and maximization of endurance. Four design variables from aerodynamics discipline namely taper ratio, aspect ratio, wing loading and wing twist are considered. Also, four more design variables from the structures discipline namely the upper and lower skin thicknesses at root and tip of the wing are added. Constraints are stall speed, maximum speed, rate of climb, strength and stiffness. The 2D airfoil and 3D wing aerodynamic analysis is performed by the XFLR5 panel method code and the structural analysis is performed by the MSC-NASTRAN finite element code. In the optimization process, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm named NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm) is used to discover the full Pareto front for the dual objective problem. In the second step, in order to reduce the time of computation, the analysis tools are replaced by a Kriging meta-model.

Both the passively adaptive structure and the shape of the flexible wing aerofoil are optimised for best aerodynamic performance under aero-structural constraints, within a coupled aeroelastic formulation. A typical flight mission for surveillance purposes is considered and includes the potential occurrence of wind gusts. A metamodel for the high-fidelity objective function and each of the constraints is built, based on a tuned low-fidelity one, in order to improve the efficiency of the optimisation process. Both metamodels are based on solutions of the aeroelastic equations for a flexible aerofoil but employ different levels of complexity and computational cost for modelling aerodynamics and structural dynamics within a modal approach. The high-fidelity model employs nonlinear Computational Fluid Dynamics coupled with a full set of structural modes, whereas the low-fidelity one employs linear thin aerofoil theory coupled with a reduced set of structural modes. The low-fidelity responses are then corrected according to few high-fidelity responses, as prescribed by an appropriate Design of Experiment, by means of a suitable tuning technique. A standard Genetic Algorithm is hence utilised to find the global optimum, showing that a flexible aerofoil is characterised by higher aerodynamic efficiency than its rigid counterpart. Wing weight reduction is also accomplished when a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm is adopted."

However, such research requires quality datasets to enable accurate analysis. To that end, we have collected real vehicle movement data, Multimedia Sensor Data, that contain synchronized sensor data in fine granularity such as GPS, accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, and, most importantly, matching real video images recorded at driving time. These real video images provide a way to accurately label the sensor data in generating a quality dataset, e.g., a training dataset. Then, we performed preprocessing steps to clean and refine the raw data, subsequently converted the results into csv files, which are compatible with a wide variety of analysis tools. We also provided sample cases to demonstrate methods of identifying abnormal driving patterns such as moving over a speed bump. This dataset will be useful for researchers refining their analyses of vehicle movements."

The response surface method with linear and quadratic basis functions is employed to formulate these objectives, in which optimal Latin hypercube sampling and stepwise regression techniques are implemented. In this study, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm is employed to search for Pareto solution to a full-scale vehicle design problem that undergoes both the full frontal and 40% offset-frontal crashes. The results demonstrate the capability and potential of this procedure in solving the crashworthiness design of vehicles. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."

Motivated by this problem, we introduce counting temporal logics-formal languages that enable concise expression of multirobot task specifications over possibly infinite horizons in this article. We first introduce a general logic called counting linear temporal logic plus (cLTL+), and propose an optimization-based method that generates individual trajectories such that satisfaction of a given cLTL+ formula is guaranteed when these trajectories are synchronously executed. We then introduce a fragment of cLTL+, called counting linear temporal logic (cLTL), and show that a solution to a planning problem with cLTL constraints can be obtained more efficiently if all robots have identical dynamics. In the second part of this article, we relax the synchrony assumption and discuss how to generate trajectories that can be asynchronously executed, while preserving the satisfaction of the desired cLTL+ specification. In particular, we show that when the asynchrony between robots is bounded, the method presented in this article can be modified to generate robust trajectories. We demonstrate these ideas with an experiment and provide numerical results that showcase the scalability of the method."

To implement an automatic mobile robot (e.g., an automated driving vehicle) in traffic, robustly detecting various types of objects such as cars, people, and bicycles in various conditions such as daytime and nighttime is necessary. In this paper, we propose the use of multi- spectral images as input information for object detection in traffic. Multispectral images are composed of RGB images, near-infrared images, middle-infrared images, and far-infrared images and have multilateral information as a whole. For example, some objects that cannot be visually recognized in the RGB image can be detected in the far-infrared image. To train our multispectral object detec- tion system, we need a multispectral dataset for object detection in traffic. Since such a dataset does not currently exist, in this study we generated our own multispectral dataset. In addition, we pro- pose a multispectral ensemble detection pipeline to fully use the features of multispectral images. The pipeline is divided into two parts: The single-spectral detection model and the ensemble part. We conducted two experiments in this work. In the first experiment, we evaluate our single-spectral object detection model. Our results show that each component in the multispectral image was individually useful for the task of object detection when applied to different types of objects. In the second experiment, we evaluate the entire multispectral object detection system and show that the mean average precision (mAP) of multispectral object detection is 13% higher than that of RGB-only object detection."

It works by inserting mutants and running the application's test suite to identify if the mutants are detected (killed) or not (survived) by the tests. Although computationally expensive, it has proven to be an effective method to assess application test suites. Several mutation testing frameworks and tools have been built for the various programing languages, however, very few tools have been built for the JavaScript language, more specifically, there is a lack of mutation testing tools for the Node.js runtime and npm based applications. The npm Registry is a public collection of modules of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web applications, mobile applications, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community. The over 700,000 packages hosted in npm are downloaded more than 5 billion times per week. More and more software is published in npm every day, representing a huge opportunity to share code and solutions, but also to share bugs and faulty software. In this paper, we briefly describe prior work for mutation operators in JavaScript and Node.js, and propose Mutode, an open source tool which leverages the npm package ecosystem to perform mutation testing for JavaScript and Node.js applications.

While dialog-based systems such as Siri support utterances communicated through natural language, they are limited in the flexibility they afford to the user in interacting with the system and, thus, support primarily action-requesting and information-seeking tasks. Mixed-initiative interaction, on the other hand, is a flexible interaction technique where the user and the system act as equal participants in an activity, and is often exhibited in human-human conversations. In this paper, we study user support for mixed-initiative interaction with dialog-based systems through natural language using a bag-of-words model and k-nearest-neighbor classifier. We study this problem in the context of a toolkit we developed for automated, mixed-initiative dialog system construction, involving a dialog authoring notation and management engine based on lambda calculus, for specifying and implementing task-based, mixed-initiative dialogs.We use ordering at Subway through natural language, human-computer dialogs as a case study. Our results demonstrate that the dialogs authored with our toolkit support the end user's completion of a natural language, human-computer dialog in a mixed-initiative fashion. The use of natural language in the resulting mixed-initiative dialogs afford the user the ability to experience multiple self-directed paths through the dialog and makes the flexibility in communicating user utterances commensurate with that in dialog completion paths-an aspect missing from commercial assistants like Siri."

A nearly-orthogonal sampling of design space is proposed with good space filling properties to extract maximum useful information about system behavior using much lower number of trial designs. This sampled data is then used as training data for artificial neural network, which will act as a metamodel to represent the time consuming disciplinary analyses. A stage-wise interconnection of separate neural networks is also proposed for trajectory metamodel to offset dimensionality curse of neural networks. Genetic Algorithm performs global optimization by utilizing this metamodel and subsequently sequential quadratic programming performs the local optimization utilizing exact analyses. The performance of proposed methodology is investigated in this paper for the conceptual design optimization of multistage solid fueled space launch vehicle. The results show excellent approximation of highly non-linear functions using proposed sampling and drastic reduction in overall design optimization time, due to greatly reduced number of exact disciplinary analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, energy consumption is an important factor that determines the duration of a mobile device's usage. Main memory consumes a significant portion of the total system energy especially when the mobile device is idle, which is the case most of the times. Moreover, in current and future systems, it is very likely that users tend to run various mobile applications simultaneously, which further increases the aggregate memory demands of mobile devices. Therefore, optimizations on memory energy consumption have become even more critical in those devices. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called NEMO to improve the energy efficiency of mobile devices with a hybrid DRAM/PCM main memory. Our scheme powers off as many power-hungry DRAM components as possible, as long as it does not impact the performance. Specifically, when the mobile device is in idle state, only a selective set of data that is critical to performance is kept in a single DRAM rank, while the rest of data is stored in PCM, so that the remaining DRAM ranks can be powered off. To do so, NEMO classifies memory pages based on their usage frequency and recency into hot and cold. Then, it places the hot pages that are more likely to be reused in future in the DRAM, which has lower access latency compared to PCM, and stores cold memory pages in PCM, which has near-zero idle power. In addition, NEMO predicts the number of DRAM ranks that need to be powered on when the mobile device becomes active for further energy saving. Our simulation results reveal that NEMO achieves on average, 10.2% reduction in memory power consumption and 1.7% performance improvement on a system running various combinations of Moby benchmark applications with 128MB DRAM and 1GB PCM, compared with the approach that simply puts DRAM into self-refresh low-power mode during idle state."

However, existing vehicular networks do not meet current security requirements. Typically for dynamic networks, maximal decentralization and rapidly changing topology of moving hosts form a number of security issues associated with ensuring access control of hosts, security policy enforcement, and resistance of the routing methods. To solve these problems generally, the paper reviews SDN (software defined networks) based network security architectures of VANET. The following tasks are solved in our work: composing of network security architectures for SDN-VANET (architecture with the central control and shared security servers, decentralized (zoned) architecture, hierarchical architecture); implementation of these architectures in virtual modeling environment; and experimental study of effectiveness of the suggested architectures. With large-scale vehicular networks, architectures with multiple SDN controllers are most effective. In small networks, the architecture with the central control also significantly outperforms the traditional VANET architecture. For the suggested architectures, three control modes are discussed in the paper: central, distributed and hybrid modes. Unlike common architectures, all of the proposed security architectures allow us to establish a security policy in m2m-networks and increase resistance capabilities of self-organizing networks."

Distributed consensus protocols is a mature field of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings. In this paper, we present A2: Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks. A2 introduces Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture effect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security. A2 builds on top of this reliable base layer and enables the two- and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as group membership, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying. We evaluate A2 on four public testbeds with different deployment densities and sizes. A2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes. The resulting duty cycle is 0.5% for 1-minute intervals. We show that A2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points. When adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under specific failure scenarios."

Neural Network trajectory metamodel is used by Genetic Algorithm to rapidly find near global minimum. Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) starts from this initial guess and converges to local optimal solution. The most significant contribution of meta-modeling strategy is the drastic reduction in overall computation time, due to greatly reduced number of exact analysis required. In the guidance application, SQP uses onboard neural network trajectory metamodel to rapidly optimize the profile of angle of attack.

In the context of autonomous driving, steering actuator dynamics can be difficult to model due to an integrated proprietary power steering control module. While first-principles models derived from physics laws can often approximate the system behavior, it remains generally difficult to capture non-physically derived behavior based on proprietary software algorithms in the power steering system. To overcome this limitation, this work instead employs a recurring neural network to model the steering dynamics of an autonomous vehicle. The resulting model is then integrated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control scheme to generate feedforward steering commands for embedded control. The proposed approach is compared to traditional first-principles steering modeling through on-vehicle experiments and statistical data validation. As a result, it is shown that the neural network model can be automatically generated with less domain-specific knowledge, can predict steering dynamics more accurately, and perform comparably to a high-fidelity first principles model when used for controlling the steering system of a self-driving vehicle."

The purpose of this study was to explore the underlying mechanisms of neurotoxic effects of mercurial compounds on the different stages of developing mice. Low-doses (the probability of human exposure in mercury-contaminated areas) of methylmercury (MeHg) (M, 0.02mg/kg/day) and mercury chloride (HgCl2) (H, 0.5mg/kg/day) were administered to mice of the following groups: (1) treatment with distilled water for 7 consecutive weeks after weaning (control-vehicle (CV)); exposure to mercurial compounds at different stages; (2) for 7 consecutive weeks after weaning (control-MeHg (CM) and control-HgCl2 (CH)); (3) only during perinatal and weaning stages (MeHg-vehicle (MV) and HgCl-vehicle (HV)); and (4) in all experimental stages (MeHg-MeHg (MM) and HgCl2-HgCl2 (HH)). Results revealed the neurobehavioral defects (increased locomotor activities, motor equilibrium impairment, and auditory dysfunction) that correlated with increasing Hg accumulation in CM and CH groups. However, it revealed a decrease and an increase in locomotor activities in MV and HV groups, respectively; these became more severe in MM and HH groups than in MV and HV groups. Motor equilibrium performance in MV and HV groups remained normal, while that in MM and HH groups was decreased. The most severe auditory defects (altered auditory brainstem response, ABR test) found in MM and HH groups than those in the respective CM and CH, MV and HV, including absolute wave III delays and interwave I-III latencies, which suggested that the irreversible auditory dysfunction caused by mercurial compounds. Furthermore, the alteration of lipid peroxidation (LPO), Na+/K+-ATPase activities, and nitric oxide (NOx) in the brain tissues contributed to the observed neurobehavioral dysfunction and hearing impairment. These findings provide evidence that fetuses were much more susceptible to the effects of mercurial compounds with regard to inducing severely neurotoxicological injuries as that found in human beings. The signaling of ROS/Na+-K+-ATPase/NOx plays a crucial role in the underlying mechanism for mercurial compound-induced toxic effects in offspring. © 2011."

In this paper, we report the initial findings of a two-day field study of using a social robot Pepper for guidance and edutainment at the service point of a medium-sized city in Finland. We collected observations and semi-structured interviews of altogether 89 customers visiting the service point. Fifteen specific experiences evoked by the interaction with the robot were identified and categorized under five basic needs of Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness, Stimulation and Security.

The proposed approach extracts a runtime monitoring graph from system requirements specified using UML sequence diagrams. Non-intrusive, on-chip hardware dynamically monitors the system execution, verifies the execution adheres to the requirements model, and in the event of a failure provides detailed information that can be analyzed to determine the root cause.

However they lack human element for building rapport with users. Anonymous rapport building responsive virtual humans (VHs) are known to increase users’ willingness to disclose honest information in self-report assessments. However, implementing responsive VHs is a complex task. It requires modeling verbal and non-verbal user behaviors in real-time and generating appropriate responses to address these behaviors. In our work, we investigate the use of non-responsive VHs as middle-ground between computers and responsive VHs to conduct self-report assessments. Prior research has shown that non-responsive VHs, which are unaware of users’ behavior, can provide task-related support. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability of non-responsive VHs to conduct self-report assessment. We also compared users’ reported impression management and fear of negative evaluation with computer-based assessment to measure users’ willingness to disclose honest information. We found that participants reported significantly higher usability for VH based assessment. Moreover, participants’ willingness to disclose honest information with VH was same as in computer-based assessment. We conclude that non-responsive VHs can be used to improve user experience during time consuming self-report assessments."

The proposed method uses a force sensor fixed between an end effector of the manipulator and an object to measure force/torque applied by the manipulator to the object. Then, force/torque applied by an operator are estimated by using a disturbance observer, which subtracts the sensing force/torque from those calculated based on the object acceleration. Using the force sensor makes implementation easier by isolating the object dynamics from those of the manipulator. By using a virtual internal model driven by the estimated force/torque, a task-oriented mechanical impedance is given to the object that is in reality heavy and unbalanced as if it were lighter and well-balanced. Experiments to virtualize dynamics of a rod with a weight at one end, i.e., an example of an unbalanced object, to be a uniform disc by a SCARA manipulator with three degrees-of-freedom were conducted, and the results showed the validity of the proposed method. © 2009 IEEE."

We investigated the impact of the time-granularity of the collected data and showed that training the models on higherresolution (minute-level) data improved classification performance on conditions related to mental health and nervous system disorders, as compared to using only day-level totals. In the present work we shift the focus from the time resolution of the observation windowtoits duration. We study how the performance of the best-performing model on the highest-resolution data changes as the length of the data collection windowisvaried from 3 to 147 days for each user. We found that for mental health and nervous system disorders, a model trained on 30 days of mHealth data attains the same performance as using the full 147-day window of data, in terms of AUC increase over a baseline model that uses only demographics, height, and weight. Additionally, for the same cluster of conditions, only 7 days of data are sufficient to realize 62% of the maximum increase in AUC over baseline attainable using the full window. The results suggest that for some conditions health-related digital phenotyping in free-living conditions can potentially be performed in a relatively short amount of time, imposing minimal disruptions on user habits."

It is worth remembering that the modern Internet that interconnects millions of networks is a 'complex adaptive social system', in which interventions not only cause effects but the effects have further knock-on consequences (not all of which are desirable or anticipated). We believe that self-driving networks will likely raise new unanticipated challenges (particularly in the human-facing domains of ethics, privacy, and security). In this paper, we propose the use of insights and tools from the field of ""systems thinking""-a rich discipline developing for more than half a century, which encompasses more realistic models of complex social systems-and highlight their relevance for studying the long-term effects of network architectural interventions, particularly for self-driving networks. We show that these tools complement existing simulation and modeling tools and provide new insights and capabilities.

In today’s passenger vehicles, more and more safety critical functionalities are implemented in software. Thus, its importance for functional safety increases. The dominating safety standard for the automotive domain (ISO 26262) con- siders the software part and defines requirements for safety critical soft- ware. However, applying and fulfilling the standard is a major problem in industry. In this context, the paper presents a novel metric-based approach to evaluate dataflow-oriented software architectures used in many model-driven processes regarding the fulfillment of requirements defined by ISO 26262 (in particular part 6). The core idea is to derive metrics for model-based software from already existing, well-performing metrics elaborated for other programming paradigms. To link metrics to requirements fulfillment of ISO 26262, we briefly sketch the factor-criteria- metrics paradigm for this problem. Technically, this paper presents a generic meta-model for dataflow systems, which is used to define the met- rics. We implemented this meta-model and the metrics as a prototype for Matlab Simulink. As examples, two models of a 400 kW full Drive-by- Wire experimental vehicle with all-wheel-steering, all-wheel-drive, and electro-mechanical brakes are analyzed using this prototype."

This approach, while a necessary start, is not sufficient. Such security relies on no missteps, and compromise only need a single flaw; consequently, we must design for compromise and mitigate its impact. One approach is to utilize fine-grained modularization and isolation. In such a system, decomposition ensures that compromise of a single module presents limited and known risk to data/resource theft and denial. We propose mechanisms for automating such modular composition and consider its system performance impact."

A new design concept is detailed, which consists in adding pulleys to the attachment between the cables and the end-effector. These reflective pulleys must have the same radius as the ones at the frame in order to compensate their geometry. Without this modification in the end-effector, the usual simplification of the point-to-point method used to model the connection between frame and end-effector leads to significant errors in the Kinematics and Dynamics of the system due to the fact that the geometry of the frame pulleys is disregarded. By adding the reflective pulleys in the end-effector, the equations of the Kinematics and Dynamics of the real system are equivalent to those of the point-to-point model, and therefore, this simplified method can be used without inherent errors. This solution may be of great importance for computational issues because it leads to codes that may run at real time. An analytical proof of the equivalence of both models is presented. Finally, experimental results have been conducted for both, planar and spatial cable-robots, in order to illustrate the advantages of using this novel design concept for the connection between the end-effector and the fixed frame."

The main objective of SON is to introduce automation into network management activities and reduce human intervention. SON enabled LTE networks heavily rely on the information acquired from mobile phones to provide self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing features. However, mobile phones can be attacked over-the-air using rogue base stations. In this paper, we carefully study SON related LTE/4G security specifications and reveal several vulnerabilities. Our key idea is to introduce a rogue eNodeB that uses legitimate mobile devices as a covert channel to launch attacks against SON enabled LTE networks. We demonstrate low-cost, practical, silent and persistent Denial of Service attacks against the network and end-users by injecting fake measurement and configuration information into the SON system. An active attacker can shut down network services in 2 km2 area of a city for a certain period of time and also block network services to a selective set of mobile phones in a targeted area of 200 m to 2 km in radius. With the help of low cost tools, we design an experimental setup and evaluate these attacks on commercial networks. We present strategies to mitigate our attacks and outline possible reasons that may explain why these vulnerabilities exist in the system.This research was partly performed within the SerIOT project (seriot-project.eu) the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 under grant agreement no. 780139 and received funding from the Software Campus project from DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) project no. 10044972."

Each joint of the robot manipulator was driven by an induction motor. In this work, the fractional model of each induction motor was formulated, and the matching of the induction motors with the SCARA robot is shown. For comparison purposes, the SCARA robot control was formulated by conventional PI and PD and by fractional PIς and PDδ controllers. So each induction motor was controlled by using PI and fractional PIς controllers, and for trajectory tracking control, PD and fractional PDδ controllers were designed. For tuning the PI, PIς, PD, and PDδ controllers, the PSO algorithm was used; the same restrictions were used for the PI and PD classical controllers, and ITAE index was used as a cost function to be minimized. For computing the fractional derivatives and to obtain the numerical solution of the system, the Riemann–Liouville and Grünwald–Letnikov approaches were used. The numerical simulations have shown the effectiveness of the use of fractional PIς and PDδ controllers."

The agents are considered to be autonomous entities which contain intelligence that serves for solving their selfish or common problems, and to achieve certain goals. However, the autonomous, responsive, and proactive natures of agents make the development of agent-based software systems more complex than other software systems. Furthermore, the design and implementation of a MAS may become even more complex and difficult to implement when considering new requirements and interactions for new agent environments like the Semantic Web. We believe that both domain-specific modeling and the use of a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) may provide the required abstraction, and hence support a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs. In this paper, we first introduce a DSML for MASs called SEA-ML with both its syntax and semantics definitions and then show how the language and its graphical tools can be used during model-driven development of real MASs. In addition to the classical viewpoints of a MAS, the proposed DSML includes new viewpoints which specifically support the development of software agents working within the Semantic Web environment. The methodology proposed for the MAS development based on SEA-ML is also discussed including its example application on the development of an agent-based stock exchange system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such systems are called ""eternal software systems"". In contrast to the traditional view of development and execution as separate cycles, these modern software systems should not present such a separation. Research in MDE has been primarily concerned with the use of models during the first cycle or development (i.e. during the design, implementation, and deployment) and has shown excellent results. In this paper the author argues that an eternal software system must have a first-class representation of itself available to enable change. These runtime representations (or runtime models) will depend on the kind of dynamic changes that we want to make available during execution or on the kind of analysis we want the system to support. Hence, different models can be conceived. Self-representation inevitably implies the use of reflection. In this paper the author briefly summarizes research that supports the use of runtime models, and points out different issues and research questions. © 2009 IEEE."

However, because of the modeling difficulty and low efficiency of the existing solutions, this task is usually performed offline. In this paper, an online parameter optimization method is developed. Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) is utilized to model the relationship between the process parameters and system performance. The GPR surrogated Bayesian Optimization Algorithm(GPRBOA) is proposed to optimize the process parameters. To reduce the risk of converging to a local minimum, a random variation factor is added to the Lower Confidence Bound(LCB) acquisition function to balance the exploration and exploitation processes. To deal with the computational burden of GPR, a switching criterion is proposed to coordinate the optimization process and production process to reduce the computational complexity. Experiments were performed using a peg-in-hole process. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to Design Of Experiment(DOE) methods. The proposed method is the first attempt of model-driven assembly process parameter optimization and will generate big economic impact."

This problem has been long investigated for TMs not supporting nesting, but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been studied in the context of PN-TMs. Indeed, the problem complexity is inherently exacerbated in PN-TMs, since these require to identify the optimal parallelism degree not only for top-level transactions but also for nested sub-Transactions. The increase of the problem dimensionality raises new challenges (e.g., increase of the search space, and proneness to suffer from local maxima), which are unsatisfactorily addressed by self-Tuning solutions conceived for flat nesting TMs. We tackle these challenges by proposing AUTOPN, an on-line self-Tuning system that combines model-driven learning techniques with localized search heuristics in order to pursue a twofold goal: i) enhance convergence speed by identifying the most promising region of the search space via model-driven techniques, while ii) increasing robustness against modeling errors, via a final local search phase aimed at refining the model's prediction. We further address the problem of tuning the duration of the monitoring windows used to collect feedback on the system's performance, by introducing novel, domain-specific, mechanisms aimed to strike an optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy of the self-Tuning process. We integrated AUTOPN with a state of the art PN-TM (JVSTM) and evaluated it via an extensive experimental study. The results of this study highlight that AUTOPN can achieve gains of up to 45× in terms of increased accuracy and 4× faster convergence speed, when compared with several on-line optimization techniques (gradient descent, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm), some of which were already successfully used in the context of flat nesting TMs."

Learning to recognize, modify, and regulate brain states is critical to all children's development and can improve learning, and emotional and mental health outcomes. How can we design usable and effective NF BCIs that help children learn and practice brain state self-regulation? Our contribution is a list of challenges for this emerging design space and a conceptual framework that addresses those challenges. The framework is composed of five interrelated strong concepts that we adapted from other design spaces. We derived the concepts reflectively, theoretically, and empirically through a design research process in which we created and evaluated a NF BCI, called Mind-Full, designed to help children living in Nepal who had suffered from complex trauma learn to self-regulate anxiety and attention. We add rigor to our derivation methodology by horizontally and vertically grounding our concepts, that is, relating them to similar concepts in the literature and instantiations in other artifacts.We illustrate the generative power of the concepts and the inter-relationships between them through the description of two new NF BCIs we created using the framework for urban and indigenous children with anxiety and attentional challenges. We then show the versatility of our framework by describing how it inspired and informed the conceptual design of three NF BCIs for different types of self-regulation: selective attention and working memory, pain management, and depression. Last, we discuss the contestability, defensibility, and substantiveness of our conceptual framework in order to ensure rigor in our research design process. Our contribution is a rigorously derived design framework that opens up this new and emerging design space of NF BCI's for children for other researchers and designers."

However, significant impact on the design and manufacturing of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as vehicles has not yet been achieved. This paper describes challenges of and solution approaches to building a comprehensive design tool suite for complex CPS. The primary driver for the OpenMETA tool chain was to push the boundaries of the ""correct-by-construction"" principle to decrease significantly the costly design-build-test-redesign cycles in design flows. In the discussions we will focus on the impact of heterogeneity in modeling CPS. This challenge is compounded by the need for rapidly evolving the design flow by changing/updating the selection of modeling languages, analysis and verification tools and synthesis methods. Based on our experience with the development of OpenMETA and with the evaluation of its performance in a complex CPS design challenge we argue that the current vertically integrated, discipline-specific tool chains for CPS design need to be complemented with horizontal integration layers that support model integration, tool integration and design process integration. This paper will examine the OpenMETA technical approach to construct the new integration layers, provides and overview of the technical framework we established for their implementation and summarize our experience with their application. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We propose a novel formulation to solve this problem, with an emphasis on guarantees for model discrimination and optimality, in contrast to a previously proposed conservative formulation using robust optimization. This new formulation can be recast as a bilevel optimization problem and further reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Moreover, our fairly general problem setting allows the incorporation of objectives and/or responsibilities among rational agents. For instance, each driver has to obey traffic rules, while simultaneously optimizing for safety, comfort and energy efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for identifying the intention of other vehicles in several driving scenarios."

The practical hydrothermal system is highly complex and possesses nonlinear relationship of the problem variables, cascading nature of hydro reservoirs, water transport delay and scheduling time linkage that make the problem of optimization difficult using standard optimization methods. To overcome these problems, the proposed quasi-oppositional teaching learning based optimization (QOTLBO) is employed. To show its efficiency and robustness, the proposed QOTLBO algorithm is applied on two test systems. Numerical results of QOTLBO are compared with those obtained by two phase neural network, augmented Lagrange method, particle swarm optimization (PSO), improved self-adaptive PSO (ISAPSO), improved PSO (IPSO), differential evolution (DE), modified DE (MDE), fuzzy based evolutionary programming (Fuzzy EP), clonal selection algorithm (CSA) and TLBO approaches. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm appears to be the best in terms of convergence speed, solution time and minimum cost when compared with other established methods. This method is considered to be a promising alternative approach for solving the short-term HTS problems in practical power system. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

However, TM wing has a lower aerodynamic efficiency (C L/CD) compared to membrane and rigid wing. This is due to massive drag penalty created on TM wing, which had overwhelmed the successive increase in its lift generation. Therefore, further CL/C Dmax optimization on TM wing is needed to obtain the optimal condition for the morphing wing configuration. In this paper, two-way fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation and wind tunnel testing method are used to solve and study the basic wing aerodynamic performance over (non-optimal) TM, membrane and rigid wings. Then, a multifidelity data metamodel based design optimization (MBDO) process is adopted based on the Ansys-DesignXplorer frameworks. In the adaptive MBDO process, Kriging metamodel is used to construct the final multifidelity CL/CD responses by utilizing 23 multi-fidelity sample points from the FSI simulation and experimental data. The optimization results show that the optimal TM wing configuration is able to produce better CL/CD max magnitude by at least 2% than the non-optimal TM wings. The flow structure formation reveals that low TV strength on the optimal TM wing induces low CD generation which in turn improves its overall C L/CDmax performance. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA."

One of the major concerns about a BEV battery pack is the process of aging, and the loss of driving range over the years of utilization. The phenomenon of capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries has been under scientific investigation for many years. Meanwhile, it is commonly accepted that the effects of temperature play an important role in this context [1-6]. Moreover, among others, the dynamic temperature behavior dictates the performance of the battery pack. The dimensioning of the cooling plays an important role in this manner [7]. In the early concept phase of a BEV and in this case the battery pack, many decisions must be made which have a major influence on the aforementioned aspects. Normally, simulation models are created to answer essential initial questions and to assist the cell selection process, as well as more general conceptual questions regarding the whole battery pack. More complex simulation models like 3D electrochemical or electrothermal finite element models require a great deal of computational power, especially when transient simulations are needed to answer important questions [8]. Therefore, a method is developed, which can speed up those simulations by a factor of more than 1,000 without losing to much accuracy of result. By creating metamodels with standardized pre-simulations of the models, the dynamic behavior can be emulated. It is shown, that by evaluating these meta-models in sequence, transient simulations can be executed without the time-consuming solving process of finite element models. Hence, it is possible to investigate a multitude of possible configurations in a much shorter and less computational expensive way."

However, most existing optimization tools are specifically designed for a single machine setup, and cannot handle vast volume of data. In this work, we build a distributed computing framework towards optimizing generalized linear models with billions of variables.

Then, we introduce an efficient and scalable approach to compute the second order derivatives of loss function, and optimizes model parameters with limited memory requirement.

The path is approximated with a spline that consists of multiple Bernstein-Bézier curves that are merged together in a way that continuous curvature of the spline is achieved. The article presents the approach for optimization of velocity profile of Bernstein-Bézier spline subject to velocity and acceleration constraints. For the purpose of optimization, velocity and turning points are introduced. Based on these singularity points, local segments are defined where local velocity profiles are optimized independently of each other. From the locally optimum velocity profiles, the global optimum velocity profile is determined. Since each local velocity profile can be evaluated independently, the algorithm is suitable for concurrent implementation and modification of one part of the curve does not require recalculation of all local velocity profiles. These properties enable efficient implementation of the optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm is also suitable for the splines that consist of Bernstein-Bézier curves that have substantially different lengths. The proposed optimization approach was experimentally evaluated and validated in simulation environment and on real mobile robots."

At design time, the architects choose and tune the actual vehicle device models through their power requirements and, if appropriate, quality levels. The generated implementation is then embedded in the existing Autosar models.

Conventionally, the design of overload control is ad-hoc for individual service. However, service-specific overload control could be detrimental to the overall system due to intricate service dependencies or flawed implementation of service. Service developers usually have difficulty to accurately estimate the dynamics of actual workload during the development of service. Therefore, it is essential to decouple the overload control from service logic. In this paper, we propose DAGOR, an overload control scheme designed for the account-oriented microservice architecture. DAGOR is service agnostic and system-centric. It manages overload at the microservice granule such that each microservice monitors its load status in real time and triggers load shedding in a collaborative manner among its relevant services when overload is detected. DAGOR has been used in the WeChat backend for five years. Experimental results show that DAGOR can benefit high success rate of service even when the system is experiencing overload, while ensuring fairness in the overload control."

Our previous studies have proved that nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream genes served as a key mechanism for protection against oxidative stress. Paeonol (PN) is reputed to possess a broad range of therapeutic properties probably by virtue of its antioxidative ability. However little is elucidated regarding the underlying mechanisms in ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to explore PNs effect in ischemic injury and the role of the pAkt, Nrf2 and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the mice brains of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Methods: Male CD-1 mice were subjected to pMCAO and randomly divided into five groups: Sham (sham-operated. + 0.9% saline), pMCAO (pMCAO + 0.9% saline), Vehicle (pMCAO + vehicle), PN-L (pMCAO + PN 30. mg/kg) and PN-H (pMCAO + PN 60. mg/kg) groups. PN was pre-administered intragastrically once daily for 3 days and with the last administration at 30. min before the operation in the fourth day. Neurological deficit scores, brain water content and infarct volume were measured at 24. h after pMCAO. Western blot and qRT-PCR were employed to determine the expressions of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1 and claudin-5. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by spectrophotometer. Results: Compared with Vehicle group, PN significantly alleviated neurological deficit, infarct volume and brain edema (P< 0.05), upregulated the expression of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1and SOD (P< 0.05), decreased the level of MDA (P< 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of claudin-5 was also enhanced. Conclusions: PN reduced ischemic brain injury after pMCAO; this effect may be accompanied with upregulation of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1 and ameliorating BBB permeability."

In this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting panorama images with geometrical models can be done simply in VR itself and can signicantly increase the feeling of immersion a viewer experiences. We propose a novel interactive modeling tool that allows users to model geometry depicted in a surround-panoramic scene directly in VR, utilizing projection mapping of the panorama on top of the evolving geometry. The user interface is intuitive and allows novice users to produce geometry that approximates ground truth models su-ciently to enhance a user's VR viewing experience. We designed a user study that compares users' self-reported levels of immersion, scene realism, and discomfort on a set of created models and comparison cases. Our results indicate that our modeled scenes produce a signicantly higher sense of immersion than a basic dome geometry for the panorama when viewed in VR with head orientation and position tracking."

Statecharts present an appropriate formal and visual design model to design apps and support automatic code generation. However, these designs assume a specific and static sensor-actuator configuration. We propose parametric statecharts, an extension to statecharts that can be automatically customised to a dynamic smart-home's configuration. We develop a translator to convert parametric statecharts into standard statecharts customised to a given system configuration, and then a custom compiler to generate Android code. Experimental results confirm the exibility of the proposed approach."

Yet understanding activity tracking in practice is crucial, as tracking technologies become important tools for health promotion and health insurance programs. In this paper, we describe a method for a longitudinal participantdriven photo elicitation study of activity tracking. During the five-month long study, our drop-out rates were low and we observed idiosyncratic practices with lapses and particular use patterns among participants along with significant self-reflection on activity tracking as a practice. We describe our method in detail, discussing the necessary adaptations for the study of activity tracking practices. We offer our experiences of benefits and challenges of this process, and suggest points for consideration for future studies in the area."

In the context of environmental analysis, operators typically focus their attention where measurements belong to a region of interest (e.g., when monitoring a body of water we might want to determine where the pH level is above a critical threshold). Most of the previous work in the literature represents the environmental phenomena with a Gaussian Process model, and then uses such a model to determine the best locations for measurements [3, 7]. In this paper we consider a specific scenario where a mobile platform with low computational power can continuously acquire measurements with a negligible cost. In this scenario, we seek to reduce the distance traveled by the mobile platform as it gathers information and to reduce the computation required by this path selection process. Starting from the LSE algorithm [7], we propose two novel approaches, PULSE and PULSE-batch, that exploit a new fast path selection procedure. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches on two datasets: a dataset of the pH level of the water, acquired with a mobile watercraft, and a publicly available dataset that represents CO2 maps. Results show that our techniques can compute informative paths with a computation time that is an order of magnitude lower than other techniques."

An improved RRT algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the 3D environment model is established for the path planning of mobile robot under complex rugged terrain, and the task requirements are analyzed. Then, based on the basic RRT algorithm, a new node acceptance criterion is proposed for the particularity of 3D environment. This acceptance criterion of new node take into account the variation of terrain height, the smooth of path, and the kinematics constraints such as turning radius and pitch angle of the mobile robot.

The creation of optimal complementary patrol routes for multiple agents targeting temporal event hotspots and minimizing travel distance is an NP-hard combinatorial problem that belongs to a class of problems known as the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). Traffic safety patrol routing problems share many characteristics of VRPTW problems but differ in ways that prevent the application of existing solutions. In our approach, nondeterministic patrol routing algorithms are used to specify the movements of simulated mobile agents on a roadway system. Nondeterminism is critical in the traffic safety patrol routing domain, as rigidity and predictability can negatively impact the effectiveness of law enforcement agents' efforts.This paper addresses the problem of expressing, executing, evaluating, and engaging patrol routing algorithms that target event hotspots on roadways. The patrol algorithms are first expressed using Turn, which is our extensible domain-specific language (DSL) created for this purpose. Algorithms specified using Turn syntax are then executed in a custom simulation environment. Utilizing predefined metrics, users evaluate the resulting patrol routes to ensure that the criteria of interest in a given patrol context are met. Acceptable patrol routes are then engaged by end users via a web-based geographic information system (GIS) portal. To demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of our approach, we present two illustrative case studies. © 2010 IEEE."

The algorithm includes information dimensionality reduction representation, inter-layer information interaction, online heuristic function and sequential allocation method, which effectively improve the collected information and reduces the computational complexity. In addition, as the layer increases, this algorithm can guarantee the patrolling performance of the multi-agent system without increasing the computational complexity for each sub-leader.

Each node has the ability to communicate with other nodes via the creation of routing path. However, due to the fact that nodes in MANET are autonomous and the routing paths created are only based on current condition of the network, some of the paths are extremely instable. In light of these shortcomings, many research works emphasizes on the improvement of routing path algorithm. Regardless of the application the MANET can support, the MANET possesses unique characteristics, which enables mobile nodes to form dynamic communication irrespective the availability of a fixed network. However the inherent nature of MANET has led to nodes in MANET to be vulnerable to denied services. A typical Denial of Service (DoS) in MANET is the Black Hole attack, caused by a malicious node, or a set of nodes advertising false routing updates. Typically, the malicious nodes are difficult to be detected. Each node is equipped with a particular type of routing protocol and voluntarily participates in relaying the packets. However, some nodes may not be genuine and has been tampered to behave maliciously, which causes the Black Hole attack. Several on demand routing protocol e.g. Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) are susceptible to such attack. In principle, the attack exploits the Route Request (RREQ) discovery operation and falsifies the sequence number and the shortest path information. The malicious nodes are able to utilize the loophole in the RREQ discovery process due to the absence of validation process. As a result, genuine RREQ packets are exploited and erroneously relayed to a false node(s). This paper highlights the effect Black Hole nodes to the network performance and therefore substantiates the previous work done [1]. In this paper, several simulation experiments are iterated using NS-2, which employed various scenarios and traffic loads. The simulation results show the presence of Black Hole nodes in a network can substantially affects the packet delivery ratio and throughput by as much as 100%."

This deployment strategy necessitates new cost-effective, high capacity, scalable and flexible backhaul solutions especially in urban environments where traditional solutions, such as fiber and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) are too expensive and time consuming to deploy. Traditional microwave solutions have capacity and coverage limitations. The new SCAN backhaul systems must have Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and Self-Organizing-Network (SON) capabilities to address the coverage and cost problems. In earlier work we proposed a NLOS Small Cell Backhaul (SCB) system based on diffracted signals where Cognitive Radio Technology (CRT) is proposed to add intelligence to the radio devices, giving the system SON capabilities expected of 5G systems. NLOS operation and Millimeter Wave (mmW) technology are proposed to address the coverage and capacity problems respectively. In this paper experimental results of NLOS radio link and QoS performance measurements for a prototype 17GHZ radio system designed for use as a SCB system are presented. The system addresses the cost problem by using unlicensed spectrum bands and diffracted signals to enable NLOS operation, thus addressing the street level to roof top backhaul coverage problem. The results obtained show that NLOS links that meet the radio and QoS performance requirements of small cell backhaul links can be established in an urban canyon type of environment."

Cracks, dikes and joints represent the former while tight crystalline rocks and impermeable fault gouge/seals represent the latter. In many cases, the local permeability can change instantaneously from one extreme to the other. Instantaneous permeability changes can occur when pore pressures increase to a level sufficient to induce hydro-fracture, or when slip during an earthquake ruptures a high fluid pressure compartment within a fault zone. This 'toggle switch' permeability suggests that modeling approaches that assume homogeneous permeability through the whole system may not capture the real processes occurring. An alternative approach to understanding permeability evolution, and modeling fluid pressure-controlled processes, involves using local permeability rules to govern the fluid pressure evolution of the system. Here we present a model based on the assumption that permeability is zero when a cell is below some failure condition, and very large locally (e.g. nearest neighbors) when the failure condition is met. This toggle switch permeability assumption is incorporated into a cellular automaton model driven by an internal fluid source. Fluid pressure increases (i.e. from porosity reduction, dehydration, partial melt) induce a local hydro-fracture that creates an internally connected network affecting only the regions in the immediate neighborhood. The evolution, growth, and coalescence of this internal network then determines how fluid ultimately flows out of the system when an external (drained) boundary is breached. We show how the fluid pressure state evolves in the system, and how networks of equal pore pressure link on approach to a critical state. We find that the linking of subnetworks marks the percolation threshold and the onset of a correlation length in the model. Statistical distributions of cluster sizes show power law statistics with an exponential tail at the percolation threshold, and power laws when the system is at a critical state. The model provides insights into mechanisms that can establish long-range correlations in flow networks, with applications to earthquake mechanics, dehydration, and melting.

Health management, however, even when self-driven, is inherently social and depends on a person’s direct relationships and broader sociocultural contexts, as an emerging line of research is coming to recognize, study, and support. This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients’ complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations. Based on these insights, we offer a model of this social ecology, along with design implications for personal informatics systems that are sensitive to these interpersonal contexts."

Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users' needs in specific contexts of use. Thus, it represents a contribution to obtaining low threshold/high ceiling environments.

The first two contexts require an alternative to classic probe / SIEM / SOC solutions. These contexts and domain-specific requirements and constraints influence the architecture of cyber defense solutions for the battlefield. This paper, based on an operational use case, reviews first the cybersecurity context and specificities of the modern battlefield, including a review of the evolution of the cyber-threat. Next, it sketches briefly the concept of Multi Agent System to introduce it in the military context. Its third part describes the use case studied in the context of IST 152's RTG. Taking the example of a Ground-Air Defense system, it shows that three options are available for deploying Multi Agent Systems for the Cyber defense of military systems. Finally, introducing IST 152 RTG's MASC (Multi Agent System for Cyber defense) Reference Architecture, we argue that it represents a valuable short-term solution within the frame of operational constraints previously exposed. We conclude that the feasibility of using Multi Agent System technologies for cyber defense still depends on a vast program of research."

A major data source for PhV is large-scale longitudinal observational databases (LODs) [6] such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical insurance claim databases. Inspired by the Multiple Self-Controlled Case Series (MSCCS) model [27], arguably the leading method for ADE discovery from LODs, we propose baseline regularization, a regularized generalized linear model that leverages the diverse health profiles available in LODs across different individuals at different times. We apply the proposed method as well as MSCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that incorporatingthe heterogeneity among different patients and different times help to improve the performance in identifying benchmark ADEs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ground truth [26]."

The shearing process is simulated using a Molecular Dynamics technique and meta-models of both energy and strain are constructed using an Evolutionary Neural Network that itself evolved through a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm. Simultaneous optimization of deformation and energy absorption is conducted with a Predator-prey Genetic Algorithm and the resulting Pareto frontiers are analyzed and discussed. The findings show good correspondence with existing experimental observations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Existing techniques however either require a dedicated hardware or produce inaccurate measurements. To fill in this gap, we propose a phone-based oxygen level estimation system, called PhO2, using camera and flashlight functions that are readily available on today’s off-the-shelf smart phones. Since phone’s camera and flashlight are not made for this purpose, utilizing them for oxygen level estimation poses many challenges. We introduce a cost-effective add-on together with a set of algorithms for spatial and spectral optical signal modulation to amplify the optical signal of interest while minimizing noise. A light-based pressure detection algorithm and feedback mechanism are also proposed to mitigate the negative impacts of user’s behavior during the measurement. We also derive a non-linear referencing model that allows PhO2 to estimate the oxygen level from color intensity ratios produced by smartphone’s camera. An evaluation using a custom-built optical element on COTS smartphone with 6 subjects shows that PhO2 can estimate the oxygen saturation within 3.5% error rate comparing to FDA-approved gold standard pulse oximetry. A user study to gauge the reception of PhO2 shows that users are comfortable self-operating the device, and willing to carry the device when going out."

Publication rights licensed to ACM.We tackle the problem of enabling Autonomous Systems to evaluate network providers on the basis of their adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) regarding interconnection agreements. In current Internet practices, choices of interconnection partners are driven by factors such as word of mouth, personal relationships, brand recognition and market intelligence, and not by proofs of previous performance. Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimentary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore. Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently-emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements. We propose the concept of SLA score to evaluate network providers and introduce a privacy-preserving protocol that allows networks to compute and verify SLA scores."

Meanwhile, the overall charging demand usually significantly varies in both spatial and time domains. So the availability of public charging facilities usually do not match the exact demand during different hours of the day. However, the rapid development of driverless technology provides a new possibility to solve this problem. Unmanned EVs not only facilitates the collection of integrated datasets, but also reduce the user's impact on charging events. In this paper, we introduce a new charging facility - mobile charging vehicles (MCVs), which has dedicated personnel on duty and carries batteries that can be used for charging other EVs. We propose three different scheduling strategies of MCVs and evaluate the performance through a real world EVs charging dataset. Our experiment shows that the addition of MCVs to current charging facilities greatly increase the charging efficiency, in both waiting time of EVs and the load rate of stations."

Thus, it is imperative that the design of any security-aware CPS considers the impact of the human interaction with the system on security guarantees. Yet, there has been very little work on design of Human-CPS that promotes human situational awareness for enhanced system performance, particularly in terms of cyber-physical security and real-time defense against attacks. One of the main obstacles to the rapid advancement of this field is the scarcity of testbeds for evaluating security-aware Human-CPS interactions. We present RESCHU-SA, an extendable virtual platform that facilitates studying the impact that HOL has on security of CPS with varying levels of autonomy. It allows users to analyze how inductive reasoning and ability to provide context, particularly during an attack, affects the overall CPS security guarantees. The proposed platform is an extension of the Research Environment for Supervisory Control of Heterogeneous Unmanned Vehicles (RESCHU) simulation environment, previously used in various applications including studies focused on supervising Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) missions and evaluation of interface usability."

Cooperative driving with the connected vehicles is regarded as a promising driving pattern to significantly improve transportation efficiency and traffic safety. Nevertheless, unreliable vehicular communications also introduce packet loss and transmission delay when vehicular kinetic information or control commands are disseminated among vehicles, which brings more challenges in the system modeling and optimization. Currently, no data has been yet available for the calibration and validation of a model for ITS, and most research has been only conducted for a theoretical point of view. Along this line, this paper focuses on the (theoretical) development of a more general (microscopic) traffic model which enables the cooperative driving behavior via a so-called inter-vehicle communication (IVC). To this end, we design a consensus-based controller for the cooperative driving system (CDS) considering (intelligent) traffic flow that consists of many platoons moving together. More specifically, the IEEE 802.11p, the de facto vehicular networking standard required to support ITS applications, is selected as the IVC protocols of the CDS, in order to investigate how the vehicular communications affect the features of intelligent traffic flow. This study essentially explores the relationship between IVC and cooperative driving, which can be exploited as the reference for the CDS optimization and design."

Recent work introduced the concept of distributed control in irrigation systems, but existing control strategies either do not take advantage of the distributed control, or don't revise the strategy over time in response to collected data.

In addition to substantial improvements in ease-of-use, we find across 4 weeks of large-scale irrigation system deployment that PICS improves system efficiency by 12.0% in comparison to industry best and 3.3% in comparison to academic state-of-the-art. Despite using less water, PICS also was found to improve quality of service by a factor of 4.0x compared to industry best and 2.5x compared to academic state of the art."

POOH (Percept Oriented Object Hierarchy) is a hybrid agents model driven by utility functions. These functions encapsulate conceptually economic notions of actual human as opposed to more normatively correct decision making. The utility functions are characterized by two underlying notions. First, ""losses loom larger than gains"", individuals are more concerned about changes in utility states than the state itself. Second, the additive nature of utility that is associated with neoclassical economics is dropped for more reference based or ""framed"" utility functions. Experimental analysis reveals that by incorporating utility functions in this manner into the decision-making module an agent becomes capable of both autonomous behavior and robust enough to handle uncertainties."

However, very limited experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of Doppler shift on the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication range and reliability with high speed mobility. The current work-in-progress research aims to quantify the impact of Doppler effects on V2V communication reliability, range, and reachability using singlehop Dedicated Short Range communications (DSRC) between two opposite traffic. We conducted our experiments by mounting the after-market DSRC on-board units on the dashboard of two vehicles that cross each other from opposite directions with constant relative speeds on a real interstate freeway. Our preliminary results indicate that the communication time and range drop to approximately 70% and 40% after the two vehicles cross and start moving away from each other with the average relative speeds of 110 and 140 mph, respectively. Similarly, the packet delivery ratio is also drastically reduced after the vehicles start moving away from each other. Apparently, these results indicate that there might be a strong effect of Doppler phenomena on the transmission range, packet delivery rate and the duration of the communication."

In this paper, we design a novel receiver-driven semi-broadcast scheme for vehicular applications, where receivers request broadcasting to their neighbors and data is broadcasted as a response.

Meanwhile, Mobile devices have evolved far beyond the stereotypical personal devices and been employed in various traditional real-time embedded domains. Of the currently available mobile systems, Android has seen the most widespread deployment outside of the consumer electronics market. Its open source nature has prompted its ubiquitous adoption in sensing, medical, robotics, and autopilot applications. However, it is not surprising that Android does not provide any real-time guarantee since it is designed as a mobile system and optimised for mobility, user experience, and energy efficiency. Although there has been much interest [1, 2, 3] in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer, real-time OS scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel. Our work [4, 6, 7] examines the internals of Android, the Android programming model, libraries and core systems services. We discuss the implications and challenges of adapting Android constructs and core system services for real-time and present a solution for each, name RTDroid, as a whole system. It is unique in that it redesigns Android's internal components, replaces Android's Dalvik/ART with a real-time Java virtual machine, FijiVM, and leverages off-the-shelf real-time OSes. RTDroid also provides an event-driven programming model [5] for the development of real-time applications. To retain a familiar style of Android application, we make a number of changes to the Android abstractions and how they interact with the underlying system as well as each other. We aim to leave legacy Android code unaffected and expose real-time features to components which have timeliness requirements. More specifically, Our programming model consist of four parts: 1) real-time constructs for real-time expressiveness, 2) a real-time extension to Android's application manifest for the real-time configuration, 3) real-time communication channels that enable construct interactions with real-time semantics, 4) pause-less memory management with scoped memory. To validate the predictability of RTDroid's implementation, we firstly report a number of micro benchmark results with RTDroid basic constructs. Then, we demonstrate three real-world applications implemented in RTDroid and provide statistic results. Our results illustrate that, at least in these use-cases, the modified platform delivers significantly better time predictability than stock Android and reduces the code complexity as compared to the traditional real-time programming paradigm, RTSJ."

User devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs), and upon receiving PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users also need information about nearby vehicles to protect themselves from dangerous situations."

The model included passive transport of eggs and early stage larvae, diel vertical movements for larvae between 7 and 10.5 mm in body-length and tidally synchronised, vertical movements for larger larvae (>9 mm body-length). The year 2000 was chosen because of the availability of ichthyoplankton data with which to initialise the model. The majority of larvae originating from spawning in the eastern Irish Sea settled into nursery grounds along the Scottish, English and Welsh coasts, in agreement with previous findings. In contrast, a significant portion of larvae originating from spawning in the western Irish Sea was transported eastwards to these same nursery grounds. Transport across the Irish Sea resulted from the onset of tidally synchronised vertical behaviour encoded in the model for older larvae. Settlement of larvae into local nursery grounds along the Irish coast was limited. Because of the prevailing winds and currents in the region, plaice eggs and larvae are unlikely to be transported from east to west; in most years spawning in the western Irish Sea probably acts as an additional source of juveniles for nursery grounds along the Scottish, English and Welsh coasts.

In this work we use a simulation framework based on the HLA (High-Level Architecture) and the modeling tool Ptolemy II to enable complex heterogeneous distributed simulations of embedded systems. In this context, we introduce a co-simulation based power estimation approach by integrating domain-specific simulators as well as off-the-shelf HDL simulator and synthesis tools. This enables cross-domain interaction and generation of realistic on-the-fly stimuli data for Register Transfer Level and Gate Level models as well as the gathering of power estimation data. We apply the framework to a Vehicle-2-X scenario evaluating an ECDSA signature processing core which ensures trustworthiness in vehicular wireless networks. To evaluate dynamic power reduction possibilities on application level we additionally introduce a V2X Message Evaluation technique to reduce signature verification efforts. It shows how realistic on-the-fly stimuli data obtained by the framework can improve the exploration and estimation of dynamic power consumption."

An important research question is how quality of service models can inform runtime adaptation. This paper presents a solution to the problem by application of control theory to improve performance of queued systems by means of architectural adaptation. In a paper presented at the previous year's QoSA conference, we showed how Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average techniques can be utilized to forecast how Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics are likely to evolve in the near future. This is particularly important in cases where systems can be adapted to counter QoS constraint violations. In this paper, we show how, given a similar type of QoS characteristic forecasts, strategies of architectural adaptation can be implemented that pre-emptively avoid QoS violations. The novelty of our approach is that we use classical control theory to ensure that our adaptation strategies are stable, in the sense that they do not oscillate between choices. We provide a description of how our control theoretic model can be implemented using context-based interception in .NET via model driven engineering. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

It is assumed that the AUVs are equipped with sensors that can measure the position states of a subset of individuals from within the aggregation being tracked. A new aggregation model based on provably stable Markov Process Matrices is shown as a viable model for representing aggregations. Then, a multi-stage state estimation architecture based on Particle Filters is presented that can estimate the time-varying model parameters in real-time using sensor measurements obtained by AUVs. To validate the approach, a historical data set is used consisting of >100 shark trajectories from a leopard shark aggregation observed in the La Jolla, CA coast area. The method is generalizable to any stable group movement model constructed using a Markov Matrix. Simulation results show that, when at least 40% of sharks are tagged, the estimated number of sharks in the aggregation has an error of 6%. This error increased to 27% when the system was tested with real data."

Most of the host systems today utilize alert-methods which are reactive by naturea drive is indicated to fail when some SMART attribute exceeds its vendor defined threshold for valid operation[4]. This approach does not take the cross correlation between different attributes into account and the fact that thresholds vary across different vendors. Unlike more conventional studies that focused on reliability statistics such as the annualized failure rate (AFR) at the population level[5], [6], we use machine learning (ML) algorithms that attempt to predict the failure of individual drives. Former ML approaches applied to the drive prediction failure domain include methods for dealing with sequential data, such as sliding windows and hidden Markov models [1], or anomaly detection algorithms, adhering to the often-low proportion of failed drives in the population [4] and [2]. We present a mechanism that performs a sophisticated samples aggregation inside a distributed database, allowing for the efficient extraction of compound features representing the behavior of the drive during a continuous time window prior its failure. We use here an open source dataset from BACKBLAZE, comprising extensive SMART information collected daily from a large drive population at its data center Thus we can use not only the last cumulative SMART counts but also include new features extracted over different time windows of drives last operational days. These capture the dynamics of the drives attributes, for example their growth rate which is highly indicative of the drive s failure probability [7]. Our results suggest that the use of compound features reduce the amount of false positives, which is primary performance measure for algorithms in the drive reliability domain[3], by as much as 60%. In a consecutive evaluation scenario a final decision is made based on a collection of the most recent data samples. This way we are able to capture more soon-to-fail drives at low cost to the false-positive rate. On average, a drive is predicted to fail long enough in advance (30 days) to allow for the modification of business strategy in fields such as drive replacement logistics. This approach, when implemented in a production environment may have a direct effect on business savings related to drive logistics."

These methods often require intermittent attention requests with manual data input. This may cause unnecessary burden to the user, leading to annoyance, frustration and possible application abandonment. We designed a novel method that uses on-screen alert dialogs to transform recurrent smartphone usage sessions into moments of data contributions and evaluate how accurately machine learning can reduce unintended interruptions. We collected sensor data from 48 participants during a 4-week long deployment and analysed how personal device usage can be considered in scheduling data inputs. We show that up to 81.7% of user interactions with the alert dialogs can be accurately predicted using user clusters, and up to 75.5% of unintended interruptions can be prevented and rescheduled. Our approach can be leveraged by applications that require self-reports on a frequent basis and may provide a better longitudinal QS experience."

We test our methods in the context of predicting signatures for online petitions using data from thousands of petitions posted on The Petition Site—one of the largest platforms of its kind. We observe that the success of these petitions is driven by a number of factors, including promotion through social media channels and on the front page of the petitions platform. We propose an interpretable model that incorporates seasonality, aging effects, self-excitation, and external effects. The interpretability of the model is important for understanding the elements that drives the activity of an online content.

Designing of an in-pipe inspection robot (IPIR) is a difficult task and hence the designer must take care of the design issues. Authors have already proposed a new design for in pipe inspection robot. This research work presents investigations into driving torque variation during its use in a full running pipe to overcome the drag caused by the flowing viscous fluid. This proposed model is a screw driver type wall press adaptable wheeled In-pipe inspection robot. It is able to move through vertical, inclined and horizontal pipes and it can easily pass through elbow of a pipe line. This model comprises of three modules- rotor, stator and control unit. The Rotor module has three wheels mounted on the outer periphery with a helix angle of 18o. Wheels of rotor follow the helical path on the internal surface of pipe line and move in the longitudinal direction inside the pipe. A mathematical model is proposed to estimate the driving torque required by the proposed robot. Driving torque is a function of forces coming on the robot due its motion inside the pipe and drag force generated due to flowing media. The torque on motor varies with change in viscosity of flowing fluid inside the pipe, speed of fluid and pipe inclination. The form and skin drag forces are predicted using computational fluid dynamic approach through ANSYS fluent software and robot driving torque variation is studied under full running pipe."

The drive from both domains is for more functionality and efficiency from vehicles. The resultant effect on system development means the complexity of the designs has increased and thus the complexity of the virtual simulations used for test and analysis has also increased. When actual systems or their components are integrated with the simulation environment, live-virtual testing places real-time demands on the testing of the architecture and environment. This paper describes a proposed innovative approach, derived from aerospace engineering, where the vehicle requirements are allocated to relations between the elements in the architecture and not just to system elements. An approach to using the relational oriented modelling structure for test and analysis is also described. The requirements and system architecture models specified using relational orientation are therefore seen to provide an early demonstration of a rigorous new approach to system of systems design, test and analysis that uses requirements trace ability at the architecture level. This approach promises to bring better trace ability of system requirements to the simulation of vehicle behaviour in general and to real time behaviour in particular."

However, obstacles to clinicians' ability to further adopt such data-driven medical consultations in the existing workflow remain, such as lack of time and poor interoperability. In this paper, we conducted a workshop to design a clinician interface supporting the integration of data-driven consultation into the existing workflow and investigate the role of the interface in situ. After implementing the clinician interface designed based on the workshop results, we observed 32 cases of actual use within the clinical context. We found that our interface, DataMD, helped the clinician construct a new workflow, enhanced the clinician's counseling skills, and facilitated more in-depth conversation. This paper contributes to empirically identifying the role of a clinician interface through a user-centered design approach."

The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building, etc), the Internet of Vehicles will not only upload data to the Internet with V2I.

Emerging applications utilize such data to make inferences about our physiological and health states, provide health diagnosis, and contribute to wellbeing improvements. The common approach for such applications is to collect data, either using mobile applications or special hardware, e.g., wearables, and store them on a third party storage provider. This results in many unconnected data silos of self-quantification data. Researchers and industry, advocate for a common personal storage space, to conquer the myriad of small chunks of data, deemed to be lost/forgotten in the long term. The benefits of such co-located personal data are tremendous, specifically with regards to personalized medicine, treatment, and health care. However, the centralized storage of data exacerbates the privacy and security concerns that the IoT ecosystem is facing today. In this position paper, we advocate the necessity of privacy and security guarantees for the paradigm of co-located storage of personal health data. We envision two core security functionalities: true end-to-end encryption, such that only encrypted data is stored in the cloud and secure sharing of encrypted data, without disclosing data owner's secret keys. We discuss the challenges in adopting such an end-to-end encryption paradigm while preserving the cloud's basic processing functionalities over encrypted data and how to cryptographically enforce access control."

In this case, the motor-side sensors alone are not sufficient for directly obtaining the load-side behavior. We call such problems incomplete data problems since some key information (i.e., the load-side behaviors) is missing during the identification process. This paper, thus, presents a procedure for identifying robot models even with limited load-side information. It begins by describing the relationship between the missing information and the available measurements using a Gaussian dynamic model. Then, the expectation-maximization algorithm is applied to handle the parameter estimation problem in the presence of missing information. Various relaxation techniques are utilized to alleviate the computational complexity of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on three real-world problems in industrial automation, namely the gain tuning of the Kalman filter, the friction identification, and the self-calibration of load-side inertial sensors."

This driver for flexibility also applies to the model-based applications in use in the chemical, petrochemical and polymer industries: soft-sensors, inferentials, reconciliation, model predictive control and operator training systems. It is widely recognized that a Service-Oriented Architecture can match these requirements; in particular the recently released OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) specification provides a service-oriented architecture for interoperability in industrial automation. In this work the prototype implementation of a simple process model as an OPC UA Server is presented; the model is a first-principle soft sensor that calculates a few useful physical properties from the composition of a process stream measured for example by a process gas-chromatograph. The prototype demonstrates that an OPC UA soft sensor can be self contained, performant, transparent and easy to configure. Furthermore OPC UA is a very general technology that can be used to interface process models with other software components and implement distributed simulation systems; in this sense it challenges the existing interoperability standard CAPE-OPEN. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An intensive analysis of the application requirements simplified the process of modelling the application's behavioural model; therefore, instead of modelling several variation models, the developers modelled an extra-functionality model. COCA-MDA reduces the development effort because it maintains a clear separation of concerns and employs a decomposition mechanism to produce a context-oriented component model which decouples the applications' core functionality from the context-dependent functionality. Estimating the MDA approach's productivity can help the software developers select the best MDA-based methodology from the available solutions. Thus, counting the source line of code is not adequate for evaluating the development effort of the MDA-based methodology. Quantifying the maintenance adjustment factor of the new, adapted, and reused code is a better estimate of the development effort of the MDA approaches. © 2011, IGI Global."

A core asset in engineering mobile robots is the mission specification-A formal description of the goals that mobile robots shall achieve. Such mission specifications are used, among others, to synthesize, verify, simulate, or guide the engineering of robot software. Development of precise mission specifications is challenging. Engineers need to translate the mission requirements into specification structures expressed in a logical language-A laborious and error-prone task. To mitigate this problem, we present a catalog of mission specification patterns for mobile robots. Our focus is on robot movement, one of the most prominent and recurrent specification problems for mobile robots. Our catalog maps common mission specification problems to recurrent solutions, which we provide as templates that can be used by engineers. The patterns are the result of analyzing missions extracted from the literature. For each pattern, we describe usage intent, known uses, relationships to other patterns, and-most importantly-A template representing the solution as a logical formula in temporal logic. Our specification patterns constitute reusable building blocks that can be used by engineers to create complex mission specifications while reducing specification mistakes. We believe that our patterns support researchers working on tool support and techniques to synthesize and verify mission specifications, and language designers creating rich domain-specific languages for mobile robots, incorporating our patterns as language concepts."

Traditionally, robot swarms have been developed using a codeand-fix approach: in a bottom-up iterative process, the developer tests and improves the individual behaviors of the robots until the desired collective behavior is obtained. The code-and-fix approach is unstructured, and the quality of the obtained swarm depends completely on the expertise and ingenuity of the developer who has little scientific or technical support in his activity. Property-driven design aims at providing such scientific and technical support, with many advantages compared to the traditional unstructured approach. Property-driven design is composed of four phases: first, the developer formally specifies the requirements of the robot swarm by stating its desired properties; second, the developer creates a prescriptive model of the swarm and uses model checking to verify that this prescriptive model satisfies the desired properties; third, using the prescriptive model as a blueprint, the developer implements a simulated version of the desired robot swarm and validates the prescriptive model developed in the previous step; fourth, the developer implements the desired robot swarm and validates the previous steps. We demonstrate property-driven design using two case studies: aggregation and foraging."

Therefore, there is a growing demand to utilize remote sensing images for extracting semantic objects Conventional methods are mainly focused on pixel-based classification and recently people commonly use convolutional neural networks, which post processing is required to linearize roads that are cut off and accurately shape the contours of buildings. We propose the use of a generative model to carry out this post processing in the networks. Using conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), we translate remote sensing images into map-based images from which roads are easily extracted, while retaining the underlying structure.

Proposed standard for metadata tagging with pedagogical identifiers,DeFalco J.A.,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2018,SCOPUS,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-85049810569,,"© 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.The constantly evolving domain of adaptive training warrants an examination of standards for adaptive instructional systems (AIS), specifically in the area of metadata tagging as it relates to the methods to curate, apply, and evaluate content in the authoring process. Metadata tags provide information not only to authors of AIS's, but are key in driving learning object searches. Metadata tagging represents key micro-communications between systems and search engines, and its absence limits the ability to meaningfully consume and exchange information with learning management systems. In the effort to standardize tools and methods for authoring content for generalizable AIS's, this paper will advocate for establishing a standard on metadata tagging methodology for learning objects that would include pedagogical identifier codes. The establishment of this standard would not only ease efforts in the development and implementation of learning designs for AIS's, but would promote efforts to expand the aims of AIS's to push beyond domain specific content mastery tasks to support broader cross-disciplinary discriminate intelligence in learners."

In this work, we consider balloon fish robots (BFR). This paper presents our understanding of the BFR motion obtained through simulations and experimental results. The simulation of the BFR motion is based on a traveling-wave equation, defined as the product of a sine wave and quadratic curve. In this study, we derived an equation of motion for BFR and conducted an experiment to measure the thrust force. By solving the equation of motion with the Runge–Kutta method, we are able to calculate theoretical values for the propulsion velocity of BFR. We validate the simulation by comparing theoretical and experimental propulsion speed values. As a future task, we will measure BFR thrust at more parameters."

In the present study, we examined the effect of gallic acid (GA; 100 mg/kg, p.o. for 10 days) on cognitive deficit and cerebral oxidative stress induced by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) as an animal model of vascular dementia (VD). The results showed that 2VO significantly reduced the spatial memory performance in Morris water maze as well as non-enzymatic (total thiol) and enzymatic [glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] antioxidant contents and increased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of vehicle-treated group as compared to sham-operated rats. Furthermore, chronic administration of GA significantly restored the spatial memory, total thiol and GPx contents and also decreased MDA levels in these tissues. GA alone did not show any change neither in the status of various antioxidants nor behavioral tests over sham values. The results demonstrate that GA has beneficial activity against 2VO-induced cognitive deficits via enhancement of cerebral antioxidant defense. Taken together, the present study suggested that GA might be useful in the treatment of VD. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

The multi-infarct dementia model rats were prepared by injecting man-made micro-thrombi into the right hemisphere. The administration groups were treated once daily with 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg Nicotiflorin (i.g.) from 5 days before ischemia operation to 3 days after the operation for biochemical examination, 10 days for Morris water maze study and morphological observations and 20 days for eight-arm radial maze task. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that infarct volume of each Nicotiflorin administration group was much smaller than that of vehicle-treated multi-infarct dementia group, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining showed that histopathological abnormalities of each Nicotiflorin group were also much lighter than that of vehicle-treated multi-infarct dementia group. Each Nicotiflorin group showed much better spatial memory performance in Morris water maze tests and eight-arm radial maze task compared with the vehicle-treated multi-infarct dementia group, significantly attenuated the elevation of lactic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and the decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Na+K+ATPase, Ca2+Mg2+ATPase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the brain tissue which was composed of striatum, cortex and hippocampus of the ischemia hemisphere at day 3 after ischemia operation.

AOMs provide a meta-layer architecture through which controlled (i.e. domain meaningful and correct) transformations of base-level computation can be achieved. Our work is derived from a model driven approach to systems construction, in which architectural modelling artefacts of a development process are used directly to construct a system AOM. Modification of modelling is explicitly mapped to AOM adjustment, and thus to system modification. We propose an extension to this approach to capture dynamic and autonomic concerns. We explore how resulting systems models might readily accommodate unforeseen changes in the environment and react appropriately without the need for programmer intervention. © 2006 IEEE."

In order to cope with all these issues, we present Proxy Clouds, a multiplanar superstructure for unified real-time processing of RGB-D data. By generating and updating through time a single set of rich statistics parameterized over planar proxies from raw RGB-D data, several processing primitives can be applied to improve the quality of the RGB-D stream on-the-fly or lighten further operations. We illustrate the use of Proxy Clouds on several applications, including noise and temporal flickering removal, hole filling, resampling, color processing and compression.

Given the psychomotor demands required to navigate a motor vehicle and the disastrous effects of motor vehicles accidents, patients with MDD present a population of clinical interest. The goal of this investigation was to examine the association between MDD and driving ability assessed within a simulated driving paradigm. Methods: 18 outpatients currently meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD and 29 control participants completed four 30-min simulated driving trials at 10:00 am, 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm, and 4:00 pm. Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess for depression severity and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess for everyday sleepiness. Results: After controlling for age and sleepiness, the depressed sample exhibited slower steering reaction times across trials (p < .05) and an increased number of crashes across trials (p < .05) when compared to controls. These differences were characterized by a medium effect size. No significant time-of-day effects were found. Limitations: MDD patients were free of anti-depressant medication and findings may not generalize to medicated populations. Also, a rural highway driving route was used which may not generalize well to urban driving settings. Conclusions: Patients with untreated MDD demonstrate impaired simulated driving performance. Further research into whether these findings translate into on-the-road impairment is important for public health and safety. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

To date, the empirical literature has tended to focus on the attitudes of experienced healthcare professionals working with adults who self-harm. Additionally, there has been few theory or model-driven studies to help identify what healthcare students think and feel about young people who self-harm. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to explore the way healthcare and non-healthcare students think and feel about adolescent self-harm behaviour using Corrigan et al.'s [Corrigan, P.W., Markowitz, F.E., Watson, A., Rowan, D., Kubiak, M.A., 2003. An attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Journal of Health and Social Behaviour 44, 162-179] attribution model of public discrimination towards people with mental illness. Design: The study was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, survey that consisted of two hypothetical vignettes. Settings: Two universities in England, United Kingdom. Participants: One hundred and eighty-four final-year students, covering health (medicine, nursing, clinical psychology) and non-health care (physics) professions. Methods: Students were presented with vignettes describing a young female who self-harms. Attributions of controllability were experimentally manipulated across the vignette conditions and students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring attitudes towards self-harm, familiarity with self-harm and social desirability. Results: Consistent with the public discrimination model, students who believed that a young person was responsible for their self-harm reported higher feelings of anger towards them. Anger, in turn, was associated with a belief in the manipulatory nature of the self-harm and with less willingness to help. Perceived risk was found to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased support for the use of coercive and segregatory strategies to manage self-harming behaviour. Gender and student type were important influences on public stigma, with both men and medical students reporting more negative attitudes towards self-harm. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a number of factors may adversely affect the care and treatment received by young people who self-harm, namely: students' causal attributions, the gender and profession of healthcare students, and familiarity with self-harm behaviour. To improve the effectiveness of service provision and treatment outcomes for people who self-harm, it is important that health care service providers and teaching institutions consider the implications of these factors when developing staff and services, and base interventions on theoretical models of stigma and discrimination. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there are many studies that consider ride-hailing platforms holistically, e.g., from the perspective of supply and demand equilibria, little emphasis has been placed on optimization for the individual, self-interested drivers that currently comprise these fleets. While some individuals drive opportunistically either as their schedule allows or on a fixed schedule, we show that strategic behavior regarding when and where to drive can substantially increase driver income. In this paper, we formalize the problem of devising a driver strategy to maximize expected earnings, describe a series of dynamic programming algorithms to solve these problems under different sets of modeled actions available to the drivers, and exemplify the models and methods on a large scale simulation of driving for Uber in NYC. In our experiments, we use a newly-collected dataset that combines the NYC taxi rides dataset along with Uber API data, to build time-varying traffic and payout matrices for a representative six-month time period in greater NYC. From this input, we can reason about prospective itineraries and payoffs. Moreover, the framework enables us to rigorously reason about and analyze the sensitivity of our results to perturbations in the input data. Among our main findings is that repositioning throughout the day is key to maximizing driver earnings, whereas 'chasing surge' is typically misguided and sometimes a costly move."

This bionic arm is attached to a mobile robot named Robotino. Inspired by the elephant's trunk, it can reproduce biological behaviors of trunks, tentacles, or snakes. Unlike rigid link robot manipulators, the development of high performance control algorithm of continuum robot manipulators remains a challenge, particularly due to their complex mechanical design, hyper-redundancy and presence of uncertainties. Numerous studies have been investigated for modeling of such complex systems. Such continuum robots, like the CBHA present a set of nonlinearities and uncertainties, making difficult to build an accurate analytical model, which can be used for control strategies development. Hence, learning approach becomes a suitable tool in such scenarios in order to capture un-modeled nonlinear behaviors of the continuous robots. In this paper, we present a qualitative modeling approach, based on neuronal model of the inverse kinematic of CBHA. A penalty term constraint is added to the inverse objective function into Distal Supervised Learning (DSL) scheme to select one particular inverse model from the redundancy manifold. The inverse kinematic neuronal model is validated by conducting a real-time implementation on a CBHA trunk."

Responding to the growth of the market, many alternative cloud services and their underlying systems are currently vying for the attention of cloud users and providers. To make informed choices between competing cloud service providers, permit the cost-benefit analysis of cloud-based systems, and enable system DevOps to evaluate and tune the performance of these complex ecosystems, appropriate performance metrics, benchmarks, tools, and methodologies are necessary. This requires re-examining old system properties and considering new system properties, possibly leading to the re-design of classic benchmarking metrics such as expressing performance as throughput and latency (response time). In this work, we address these requirements by focusing on four system properties: (i) elasticity of the cloud service, to accommodate large variations in the amount of service requested, (ii) performance isolation between the tenants of shared cloud systems and resulting performance variability, (iii) availability of cloud services and systems, and (iv) the operational risk of running a production system in a cloud environment. Focusing on key metrics for each of these properties, we review the state-of-the-art, then select or propose new metrics together with measurement approaches. We see the presented metrics as a foundation toward upcoming, future industry-standard cloud benchmarks."

Historically, managing cellular network configuration has been a manual, error-prone process; recently, automated solutions such as SON (Self-Organizing Networks) controllers are being deployed for dynamic tuning of network configuration to improve end-user service performance under dynamic network and traffic conditions. SON automates many aspects of cellular network configuration, but it is nonetheless susceptible to software bugs and expected traffic changes that could result in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a capability (Veracity) to analyze and quantify the performance effects of SON actions. Assessing the effects of SON control is difficult because of the dynamic nature of SON and the dependency of end-user performance on factors such as radio channel quality, mobility and traffic load. Veracity addresses these using model-driven impact detection and quantification. Our evaluation using data collected from an operational cellular network demonstrates that Veracity is accurate. Veracity is now being used by the service providers' field operation teams for the assessment of SON effectiveness in arenas and stadiums."

This is necessary to allow the system to anticipate future workload needs and select the proper optimizations in a timely manner. Previous forecasting techniques model the resource utilization of the queries. Such metrics, however, change whenever the physical design of the database and the hardware resources change, thereby rendering previous forecasting models useless. We present a robust forecasting framework called QueryBot 5000 that allows a DBMS to predict the expected arrival rate of queries in the future based on historical data. To better support highly dynamic environments, our approach uses the logical composition of queries in the workload rather than the amount of physical resources used for query execution. It provides multiple horizons (short-vs. long-term) with different aggregation intervals. We also present a clustering-based technique for reducing the total number of forecasting models to maintain. To evaluate our approach, we compare our forecasting models against other state-of-the-art models on three real-world database traces. We implemented our models in an external controller for PostgreSQL and MySQL and demonstrate their effectiveness in selecting indexes."

This paper presents a preliminary approach that uses a formal basis for querying safety cases, specifically Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) argument structures. Our approach semantically enriches GSN arguments with domain-specific metadata that the query language leverages, along with its inherent structure, to produce views.

All rights reserved.Imitation learning algorithms learn viable policies by imitating an expert's behavior when reward signals are not available. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GALL) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for learning policies when the expert's behavior is available as a fixed set of trajectories. We evaluate in terms of the expert's cost function and observe that the distribution of trajectory-costs is often more heavy-tailed for GAIL-agents than the expert at a number of benchmark continuous-control tasks. Thus, high-cost trajectories, corresponding to tail-end events of catastrophic failure, are more likely to be encountered by the GAIL-agents than the expert. This makes the reliability of GAIL-agents questionable when it comes to deployment in risk-sensitive applications like robotic surgery and autonomous driving. In this work, we aim to minimize the occurrence of tail-end events by minimizing tail risk within the GALL framework. We quantify tail risk by the Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of trajectories and develop the Risk-Averse Imitation Learning (RALL) algorithm. We observe that the policies learned with RAIL show lower tail-end risk than those of vanilla GAIL. Thus, the proposed RALL algorithm appears as a potent alternative to GALL for improved reliability in risk-sensitive applications."

However, the aerial infrared images are always low-resolution and fuzzy, ground car detection is subjected to pose variations, view changes as well as surrounding radiations, this inevitably poses many challenges to detection task. In this paper, we present a novel approach toward ground car detection on infrared images via an end to end regressive neural network, other than background segmentation or foreground extraction. The main works of our research can be divided into three parts: (1) A unique aerial moving platform is built to collect a large amount of infrared images. It is achieved by assembling the DJI M-100 UAV and the FLTR TAU2 infrared sensor; (2) An aerial infrared car data set is unprecedentedly constructed. It is can be used for the following researches in this field; (3) A ground car detection model is trained. It can work in the moving and stationary cars in some severe environments. We test it on some low-resolution infrared images in a typical urban complicated environment and compare it with a state-of-the-art method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach instantly detects cars while keeping a low leak and false alarm ratio."

The models specify how the partial or total fulfilment of non-functional requirements (NFRs) drive the decision-making process at runtime. There has been considerable progress in this research area. However, precarious progress has been made by the use of models at runtime using machine learning to deal with uncertainty and support decision-making based on new evidence learned during execution. New techniques are needed to systematically revise the current model and the satisficement of its NFRs when empirical evidence becomes available from the monitoring infrastructure. In this paper, we frame the decision-making problem and trade-off specifications of NFRs in terms of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) models. The mathematical probabilistic framework based on the concept of POMDPs serves as a runtime model that can be updated with new learned evidence to support reasoning about partial satisficement of NFRs and their trade-off under the new changes in the environment. In doing so, we demonstrate how our novel approach RE-STORM underpins reasoning over uncertainty and dynamic changes during the system's execution."

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Modeling cloth with fiber-level geometry can produce highly realistic details. However, rendering fiber-level cloth models not only has a high memory cost but it also has a high computation cost even for offline rendering applications. In this paper we present a real-time fiber-level cloth rendering method for current GPUs. Our method procedurally generates fiber-level geometric details on-thefly using yarn-level control points for minimizing the data transfer to the GPU. We also reduce the rasterization operations by collectively representing the fibers near the center of each ply that form the yarn structure. Moreover, we employ a level-of-detail strategy to minimize or completely eliminate the generation of fiber-level geometry that would have little or no impact on the final rendered image. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yarn-level ambient occlusion approximation and self-shadow computation method that allows lighting with self-shadows using relatively low-resolution shadow maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing our simplified fiber geometry to procedurally generated references and display knitwear containing more than a hundred million individual fiber curves at real-time frame rates with shadows and ambient occlusion."

The benefits associated with IMU-based joint angle measurements are ease of handling, flexibility and low cost. However, a known limitation is that the joint axes in terms of the attached IMUs need to be identified in order to decompose IMU measurements into joint angles. Conventionally, careful alignment of the IMUs with respect to the body segments and/or calibration motions are required. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to estimate the joint axes of the hip and knee joint during gait. Our method is easy to use, self-calibrating and real-time capable using the obtained IMU data during gait. In addition to prior methods, the algorithm profits from the periodicity during gait in order to deal with three (rotational) degrees of freedom (3-DoF) motions. Experiments with 8 healthy subjects walking on a motor-driven treadmill have been conducted. The joint axes converged onto the expected axes in all trials and the convergence times averaged less than 15 seconds."

A convenient definition of the notion of ease of reach can be given by creating a score (ERS) that relies on the number of distinct ways the object can be picked up from a given location. Unfortunately, the accurate calculation of ERS must rely on repeating the path planning process for every candidate position and grasp type, in the presence of obstacles. In this paper we use the bootstrap aggregation over hand-crafted, domain specific features to learn a model for the estimation of ERS. In a simulation study, we show that the estimated ERS closely matches the actual value and the speed of estimation is fast enough for real-time operation, even in the presence of a large number of obstacles in the scene."

The method generates control inputs subject to constraints of a non-linear quadrotor model and dynamic constraints imposed by actors moving in an a priori unknown way. The output plans are physically feasible, for the horizon length, and we apply the resulting control inputs directly at each time-step, without requiring a separate trajectory tracking algorithm. The online nature of the method enables incorporation of feedback into the planning and control loop, makes the algorithm robust to disturbances. Furthermore, we extend the method to include coordination between multiple drones to enable dynamic multi-view shots, typical for action sequences and live TV coverage. The algorithm runs in real-time on standard hardware and computes motion plans for several drones in the order of milliseconds. Finally, we evaluate the approach qualitatively with a number of challenging shots, involving multiple drones and actors and qualitatively characterize the computational performance experimentally."

Since the relays are multi-terminal and act as intermediaries between the source and the destination nodes, an optimal relay selection scheme is introduced to select the best relay that forwards the decoded information packets from the source to the destination nodes. Furthermore, the need to maintain better outage performance w.r.t the multiterminal relay network scheme is demonstrated in the simulation works while an optimized Dinkelbach (DB) iterative algorithm is introduced to maintain minimal end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the multi-terminal relay links."

All rights reserved.Advanced collision avoidance and driver hand-off systems can benefit from the ability to accurately predict, in real time, the probability a vehicle will be involved in a collision within an intermediate horizon of 10 to 20 seconds. The rarity of collisions in real-world data poses a significant challenge to developing this capability because, as we demonstrate empirically, intermediate-horizon risk prediction depends heavily on high-dimensional driver behavioral features. As a result, a large amount of data is required to fit an effective predictive model. In this paper, we assess whether simulated data can help alleviate this issue. Focusing on highway driving, we present a three-step approach for generating data and fitting a predictive model capable of real-time prediction. First, high-risk automotive scenes are generated using importance sampling on a learned Bayesian network scene model. Second, collision risk is estimated through Monte Carlo simulation. Third, a neural network domain adaptation model is trained on real and simulated data to address discrepancies between the two domains. Experiments indicate that simulated data can mitigate issues resulting from collision rarity, thereby improving risk prediction in real-world data."

For this, architects need to examine those requirements with regard to their architectural impact. Accessing and interpreting the requirements is however not always possible, for instance if custom requirements are yet unknown at the time when the architecture is modeled. Ideally, architectural knowledge as derived from custom requirements could be imposed upon architecture models. This paper proposes a novel concept for automated refactoring of architecture models in order to meet such requirements by formalizing architectural knowledge using model verification and model transformations. Industrial application within a telecommunications service provider is demonstrated in the domain of cloud application orchestration: service providers are enabled to autonomously customize solutions predefined by vendors according to their own internal requirements."

Various design patterns were proposed for self-adaptive systems, but their integration into a model-driven design process that, at the same time, provides formal guarantees is still a challenge. This is especially true for self-adaptive design patterns that are generic and abstract enough to provide general solutions that need to be refined prior to their concrete instantiations. In this paper, we present a structured and comprehensible modelling approach for design patterns in the refinement-based process calculus CSP. We formally show crucial properties of them and analyse the refinement-based relationship between their components, which generalises to entire patterns. Based on these analysis results, we are able to provide a first step towards a general, formally well-founded framework providing generic solutions for recurring problems in the management of self-adaptive systems."

Yet, few systems help people reflect more fundamentally on the factors that influence behaviors such as physical activity (PA). To address this research gap, we take a novel approach, examining how such reflections can be stimulated through a medium that generations of families have used for reflection and teaching: storytelling. Through observations and interviews, we studied how 13 families interacted with a low-fidelity prototype, and their attitudes towards this tool. Our prototype used storytelling and interactive prompts to scaffold reflection on factors that impact children's PA. We contribute to HCI research by characterizing how families interacted with a story-driven reflection tool, and how such a tool can encourage critical processes for behavior change.

Managing uncertainties in DSEs is challenging, and therefore, novel and solid software architecting methods, techniques and tools are needed. Our research explores the means to handle uncertainties at the software architecture level of DSEs. In this regard, we apply valuable lessons learnt from the models at runtime (M@RT) technique. This paper proposes a novel, dynamic knowledge engineering approach to handle uncertainties in DSEs at runtime using M@RT. This uncertainty handling approach aims to identify and solve two interrelated research problems: reflexivity and evolution of the ecosystem between the architecture and running system of services. Reflexivity means that the system must have knowledge of its components to make intelligent decisions based on self-awareness. In addition, we provide tool support towards automating reflexivity and evolution. Complex state machines of M@RT that serve as a dynamic knowledgebase are modeled using executable state machines, and generation of software artifacts of the model is performed at execution time. Causal connection is maintained between the runtime models and the running system. We validate and illustrate our approach using a DSE in an ambient-assisted living environment for elderly people."

Presenting a software engineering approach which covers both the analysis and design of these kinds of systems, and which deals with the open issues in the area, ROMAS (Regulated Open Multi-Agent Systems) defines a specific multi-agent architecture, meta-model, methodology and CASE tool. This CASE tool is based on Model-Driven technology and integrates the graphical design with the formal verification of some properties of these systems by means of model checking techniques. Utilizing tables to enhance reader insights into the most important requirements for designing normative open multi-agent systems, the book also provides a detailed and easy to understand description of the ROMAS approach and the advantages of using ROMAS. This method is illustrated with case studies, in which the reader may develop a comprehensive understanding of applying ROMAS to a given problem. The case studies are presented with illustrations of the developments. Reading this book will help readers to understand the increasing demand for normative open systems and their development requirements; understand how multi-agent systems approaches can be used to deal with the development of systems of this kind; to learn an easy to use and complete engineering method for large-scale and complex normative systems and to recognize how Model-Driven technology can be used to integrate the analysis, design, verification and implementation of multi-agent systems."

The IEEE 802.15.4 Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) protocol aims to address these issues by using frequency hopping to improve the transmission quality when coping with low-quality channels. However, an optimized transmission system should also try to favor the use of high-quality channels, which are unknown a priori. Hence reinforcement learning algorithms could be useful. In this work, we perform an evaluation of 9 Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms–some specific learning algorithms adapted to that case–in a IEEE 802.15.4-TSCH context, in order to select the ones that choose high-performance channels, using data collected through the FIT IoT-LAB platform. Then, we propose a combined mechanism that uses the selected algorithms integrated with TSCH. The performance evaluation suggests that our proposal can significantly improve the packet delivery ratio compared to the default TSCH operation, thereby increasing the reliability and the energy efficiency of the transmissions."

Due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth labels for event entities, which are temporal and are constrained by location, our retrieval framework is unsupervised, and its graph-based formulation addresses (a) the challenge of feature sparseness and noisiness, and (b) the semantic mismatch problem in a self-contained and principled manner. To validate our methods, we collect human annotations and conduct a comprehensive empirical study, analyzing the performance of our methods with regard to relevance, recall, and diversity. This study shows that our graph-based framework is significantly better than any individual feature source, and can be further improved with minimal supervision."

The system response is modeled as a parameterized random process. A double-loop optimization algorithm is used. The inner loop calculates the maximum response in time using a global-local search method, and transforms a time-dependent problem into a time-independent one. The outer loop calculates multiple most probable points (MPPs) which are commonly encountered in vibration problems. The dominant MPPs with the highest contribution to the probability of failure are identified. A niching genetic algorithm is used because of its ability to simultaneously identify multiple solutions. All potential MPPs are initially identified approximately and their location is efficiently refined using a gradient-based optimizer with local metamodels. Among all MPPs, the significant ones are identified using a correlation analysis. Approximate limit states are built at the identified MPPs, and the system failure probability is estimated using bi-modal bounds. The vibration response of a cantilever plate under random oscillating pressure load and a point load illustrates the proposed method. The finite-element model is used to calculate the response.

However, the claim has not been scientifically validated. Aim of the study: To assess the renoprotective effects of the crude extract and solvent fractions of E. divinorum leaves against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Materials and method: Rats of either sex were divided into seven experimental groups, each comprising six animals. Group I served as control and given vehicle (Tween 80, 2%, v/v in water) and Group II were treated with gentamicin intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg/day) for eight days. Group III-V received crude extract at three different doses 100 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Group VI received 100 mg/kg of the methanolic fraction and Group VII 100 mg/kg of the aqueous fraction. The extract was administered orally two days before and eight days concomitantly with gentamicin. Following treatment, blood and renal tissue were used to assess creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzymes and tubular necrosis using recommended procedures. In addition, free radical scavenging activity was determined using in vitro methods. Results: Gentamicin significantly increased serum creatinine and BUN, MDA and tubular necrosis in rats. It also decreased activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase as well as levels of gluthatione. Pre- and co-treatment with the crude extract and solvent fractions of Euclea divinorum leaves reversed gentamicin-induced alterations as evidenced by a decrease in tubular necrosis, serum and oxidant markers as well as by an increase in antioxidant molecules. Effect was found to decrease with dose when the crude extract was used and maximum protection was conferred by 100 mg/kg of the methanolic fraction in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Conclusions: Euclea divinorum reversed gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity, probably via its antioxidant activity. The fact that the methanol fraction conferred maximum protection suggests that semi-polar antioxidant principles might be responsible for the observed effect. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Simulation results show that the system is capable, while evaluating each node’s participation in the network, to detect on the fly nodes that do not accept messages from other nodes and that disseminate false information even while colluding with others, and while evaluating how honest is each node in the reputation system, to classify correctly nodes in most cases."

The emerging Web of Things (WoT), now being standardized at the W3C and IETF, provides new research opportunities that could help MAS enter the mainstream. In this paper, we present an approach to design scalable and flexible agent-based manufacturing systems that integrates automated planning with multi-agent oriented programming for the WoT: Autonomous agents synthesize production plans using semantic descriptions of Web-based artifacts and coordinate with one another via multi-agent organizations; engineers can program and repurpose the systems on the fly via an intuitive Web user interface. The systems use the Web as an application architecture (and not just as a transport layer), which facilitates the seamless integration of geographically distributed production cells. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented a prototypical production cell that uses industry-grade robots and an augmented reality interface for human workers. Together, these contributions demonstrate a means to achieve an intriguing vision for the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution: A global collective intelligence for manufacturing."

However, elaborating requirements for feedback loop activities for the specific case of runtime models is rather neglected. Therefore, we investigate requirements for Adaptation Models that specify the analysis, decision-making, and planning of adaptation as part of a feedback loop. In particular, we consider requirements for a modeling language of adaptation models and for a framework as the execution environment of adaptation models. Moreover, we discuss patterns for using adaptation models within the feedback loop regarding the structuring of loop activities and the implications on the requirements for adaptation models. Finally, we assess two existing approaches to adaptation models concerning their fitness for the requirements discussed in this paper. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis.

It includes a series of standardized modeling, transformation rules and other relevant standards architecture. Real-Time systems have been applied in many areas widely, but they have many nonfunctional requirements, which always crosscut the whole system modules. That may cause the code tangle and scatter, make the systems hard to design, reuse and maintain, and affect performance of systems badly. AOP is a new software development paradigm, which could attain a higher level of separation of concerns in both functional and nonfunctional matters by introducing aspect, for the implementation of crosscutting concerns. Different aspects can be designed separately, and woven into systems. This article introduces the technology of MDA, aspect-oriented, real-time systems and UML. This article takes the Aspectoriented to the MDA modeling by the UML extension mechanisms, and presents a method, which is Aspect- Oriented MDA. In this article, UML profile is utilized to construct the meta-modal specifications respectively for common Aspect-Oriented and AspectJ. So the core business logic and the crosscutting aspects can be modeled as separate, modular Aspect-Oriented PIM's and PSM's. The authors analysis non-functional requirements of the realtime systems, and then apply aspect-oriented MDA modeling to develop an example of real-time systems, and propose how to model aspects of timer and real-time constraints. Finally, in order to more clearly understand how to complete the MDA in the aspect-oriented modeling, especially in real-time system.

Using computer vision technology to achieve the semantic segmentation of environmental scenes is one of the key technology to ensure the safe driving of unmanned vehicles. In this paper, a hybrid autoencoder semantic segmentation model combining sparse autoencoder and denoising autoencoder is proposed. The model uses sparse autoencoder to conduct sparse semantic encoding and use denoising autoencoder to conduct robust semantic encoding. In this way, the features learned by the model are more conducive for semantic segmentation. Through the deep rich structure semantic segmentation model , an optimized selection of image semantics can be achieved, and further improve the semantic segmentation performance. Experiments show that this model is simpler, with less training time, and better comprehensive segmentation performance."

There are five in-vehicle distracter tasks: tuning the radio to a local station, touching the touch-screen telephone menu to a certain song, talking with laboratory assistant, answering a telephone via Bluetooth headset, and finding the navigation system from Ipad4 computer. Forty young drivers completed the driving experiment on a driving simulator. Measures of fixations, saccades, and blinks are collected and analyzed. Based on the measures of driver eye movements which have significant difference between the baseline and secondary task driving conditions, the evaluation index system is built. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) theory is applied for determining the importance weight of the evaluation index in a fuzzy environment. On the basis of the importance weight of the evaluation index, Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) method is utilized to evaluate the secondary task driving safety. Results show that driving with secondary tasks greatly distracts the driver's attention from road and the evaluation model built in this study could estimate driving safety effectively under different driving conditions."

These data-driven techniques extract models from training data, where their performance is often analyzed with respect to random errors in the training data. However, if the training data is maliciously altered by attackers, the effect of these attacks on the learning algorithms underpinning data-driven CPS have yet to be considered. In this paper, we analyze the resilience of classification algorithms to training data attacks. Specifically, a generic metric is proposed that is tailored to measure resilience of classification algorithms with respect to worst-case tampering of the training data. Using the metric, we show that traditional linear classification algorithms are resilient under restricted conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a linear classification algorithm with a majority constraint and prove that it is strictly more resilient than the traditional algorithms. Evaluations on both synthetic data and a real-world retrospective arrhythmia medical case-study show that the traditional algorithms are vulnerable to tampered training data, whereas the proposed algorithm is more resilient (as measured by worst-case tampering)."

They may be used to reason about requirements, to identify possible missing parts or conflicts. They may be used at design time to analyze the effects and trade-offs of different architectural choices before starting an implementation, anticipating the discovery of possible defects that might be uncovered at later stages, when they might be difficult or very expensive to remove. They may also be used at run time to support continuous monitoring of compliance of the running system with respect to the desired model. This paper focuses on models that support reasoning about non-functional system properties - namely, performance and reliability. It provides a taxonomy, which tries to capture the main facets that are needed to understand, choose, and use models appropriately in the various phases of software development and operation. The paper also focuses on the roundtrip from models to reality and back. The forward path is followed in model-driven development. The backward path is instead meant to enable model calibration, with the goal of building adequate abstractions, which reflect reality and its properties in a faithful manner. Calibration may be required because of flaws in the initial model or in the process that derived the implementation, or because of changes that occurred in the environment or in the requirements. This leads to the idea that models should continue to live at run time, on-line with the running implementation. Calibrated models may drive the necessary dynamic changes that may support self-adaptation of the implemented system. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

The result is a representation in MDE's M0, M1, M2 and M3 form, with increasingly robot and software independent representations, that do remain instantaneously executable, except obviously for the M3 metametamodel. The Platform Specific Model information can be added in three steps: (i) the type of the hybrid force-velocity controlled task, (ii) the hardware properties of the robot, tool and sensor, and (iii) the software properties of the applied execution framework.

The specialization of life sciences over the past decade, coupled with an increasing number of biomedical datasets available through standardized interfaces, has created opportunities towards new methods in biomedical discovery. Despite the popularity of semantic web technologies in tackling the integrative bioinformatics challenge, there are many obstacles towards its usage by non-technical research audiences. In particular, the ability to fully exploit integrated information needs using improved interactive methods intuitive to the biomedical experts. In this report we present ReVeaLD (a Real-time Visual Explorer and Aggregator of Linked Data), a user-centered visual analytics platform devised to increase intuitive interaction with data from distributed sources. ReVeaLD facilitates query formulation using a domain-specific language (DSL) identified by biomedical experts and mapped to a self-updated catalogue of elements from external sources. ReVeaLD was implemented in a cancer research setting; queries included retrieving data from in silico experiments, protein modeling and gene expression. ReVeaLD was developed using Scalable Vector Graphics and JavaScript and a demo with explanatory video is available at http://www.srvgal78.deri.ie:8080/explorer. A set of user-defined graphic rules controls the display of information through media-rich user interfaces. Evaluation of ReVeaLD was carried out as a game: biomedical researchers were asked to assemble a set of 5 challenge questions and time and interactions with the platform were recorded. Preliminary results indicate that complex queries could be formulated under less than two minutes by unskilled researchers. The results also indicate that supporting the identification of the elements of a DSL significantly increased intuitiveness of the platform and usability of semantic web technologies by domain users. © 2013 The Authors."

We propose a planning framework for the coverage of a partially known environment employing multiple robots. To cope with the limitation of having incomplete information, our planner adopts a receding horizon planning strategy where the safe trajectories of the robots are generated optimally for a short duration based on the currently available information about the workspace. Moreover, as multi-robot motion planning for coverage is a computationally complex problem, our framework clusters the robots into small groups to increase the planning efficiency dynamically. In each time horizon, the robots follow the motion plans provided by the planner, gather information about the workspace while executing their plans and update the global knowledge base about the workspace. The planning algorithm manages the activities of the robots in such a way that the energy consumption by the robots and the total time required for the complete coverage of the workspace get minimized. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical framework efficiently ensures the coverage quality of a partially known workspace, as well as scales up effectively with the number of robots and the size of the workspace."

Our work introduces the first interruptibility-aware mobile-robot system, which uses social and contextual cues online to accurately determine when to interrupt a person. We evaluate multiple non-temporal and temporal models on the interruptibility classification task, and show that a variant of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), the Latent-Dynamic CRF, is the most robust, accurate, and appropriate model for use on our system. Additionally, we evaluate different classification features and show that the observed demeanor of a person can help in interruptibility classification; but in the presence of detection noise, robust detection of object labels as a visual cue to the interruption context can improve interruptibility estimates. Finally, we deploy our system in a large-scale user study to understand the effects of interruptibility-awareness on human-task performance, robot-task performance, and on human interpretation of the robot's social aptitude. Our results show that while participants are able to maintain task performance, even in the presence of interruptions, interruptibility-awareness improves the robot's task performance and improves participant social perceptions of the robot."

In this paper, we present a system that constructs an executable robot program from a linguistic semantic specification produced by parsing a natural language sentence; in effect, our system grounds the semantic specification into the produced robot plan. The plan can then be run in a simulated environment, which allows one to infer more about the plan than was present in the initial semantic specification.

Today, special robots are used in households to perform monotonous and recurring tasks like vacuuming or mowing the lawn. In the future there may be robots that can be configured and programmed for more complicated tasks, like washing dishes or cleaning up or to assist elderly people. Nowadays, programming a robot is a highly complex and challenging task, which can be carried out only by programmers with dedicated background in robotics.

Unfortunately, these features are only present for the implementation of the robot behavior itself, but not for the accompanying user interfaces (UIs). The contributions of this paper are threefold: In a first step we introduce the idea of dedicated robotics UI frameworks which allow the reuse of UIs across robotics frameworks. The paper then presents an architecture for flexible and versatile UI frameworks for robotics applications by investigating and specifying the necessary features for such systems on a platform and programming language independent basis. The introduced ROBOTUI architecture fosters code reuse on the level of self-contained UI modules and enables the user to build new robotics related UIs based on existing UI building blocks.

To achieve true autonomy, robots need to continuously process and interact with their environment through computationally-intensive motion planning and control algorithms under a low power budget. Specialized architectures offer a potent choice to provide low-power, high-performance accelerators for these algorithms. Instead of taking a traditional route which profiles and maps hot code regions to accelerators, this paper delves into the algorithmic characteristics of the application domain. We observe that many motion planning and control algorithms are formulated as a constrained optimization problems solved online through Model Predictive Control (MPC). While models and objective functions differ between robotic systems and tasks, the structure of the optimization problem and solver remain fixed. Using this theoretical insight, we create RoboX, an end-to-end solution which exposes a high-level domain-specific language to roboticists. This interface allows roboticists to express the physics of the robot and its task in a form close to its concise mathematical expressions. The RoboX backend then automatically maps this high-level specification to a novel programmable architecture, which harbors a programmable memory access engine and compute-enabled interconnects. Hops in the interconnect are augmented with simple functional units that either operate on in-fight data or are bypassed according a micro-program. Evaluations with six different robotic systems and tasks show that RoboX provides a 29.4× (7.3 ×) speedup and 22.1× (79.4×) performance-per-watt improvement over an ARM Cortex A57 (Intel Xeon E3). Compared to GPUs, RoboX attains 7.8×, 65.5×, and 71.8× higher Performance-per-Watt to Tegra X2, GTX 650 Ti, and Tesla K40 with a power envelope of only 3.4 Watts at 45 nm."

This is achieved by battery management systems (BMSs) that can monitor changes in the present capacity of the battery. Considering their limited computational resources, an efficient scheme is necessary. The data-driven metamodel is therefore used instead of complex battery models, which can simply capture changes in the shape of the charge curve as a battery ages. In consequence of the model reformulation, the charge curve refers to the time elapsed for charging against voltage. Under constant current charging, using time instead of capacity is favorable for computationally inexpensive BMSs. The aging-relevant parameter in the metamodel is estimated in the least-squares sense. In practice, this is often difficult as the shape of the charge curve, mostly its early part, is distorted by varying battery conditions before charging. For tolerating this distortion, a robust scheme is also required. The weighted least-squares is thus used such that the early part is given less weights whereas the later part is givenmore weights. The BMS-integrated metamodel and its parameter estimator are validated by using batteries with different SOH, which concludes an estimation error less than 3%."

The existing approaches to that problem typically associate with each sign class a real-valued likelihood function and assign such a label to the unknown image that maximizes the value of this function. These template-matching techniques are usually based on arbitrary similarity metrics, such as normalized cross correlation, which do not capture the characteristics of the sign imagery. In this paper, we study the concept of a robust sign similarity measure that can be inferred from the domain-specific data. Two novel machine-learning techniques are proposed as a framework for automatic construction of such a measure from the pairs of images representing either the same or different classes. One is called SimBoost, which is a variation of the AdaBoost algorithm, and the other is based on the fuzzy regression tree framework. Through the experiments with low-quality images, we show that the proposed method admits efficient road sign recognition and outperforms the existing approaches in terms of the classification accuracy. © 2006 IEEE."

To examine the locomotor system of birds in vivo and in a surgically non-invasive manner, high-speed X-ray acquisition is the state of the art. For a biological evaluation, it is crucial to locate relevant anatomical structures of the locomotor system. There is an urgent need for automating this task, as vast amounts of data exist and a manual annotation is extremely time-consuming. We present a biologically motivated skeleton model tracking framework based on a pictorial structure approach which is extended by robust sub-template matching. This combination makes it possible to deal with severe self-occlusions and challenging ambiguities. As opposed to model-driven methods which require a substantial amount of labeled training samples, our approach is entirely data-driven and can easily handle unseen cases. Thus, it is well suited for large scale biological applications at a minimum of manual interaction. We validate the performance of our approach based on 24 real-world X-ray locomotion datasets, and achieve results which are comparable to established methods while clearly outperforming more general approaches."

Unlike existing horizon detection work, we cannot assume a priori the angle or nature (for e.g. straight line) of the horizon, due to the nature of the application domain and the data. Therefore, the proposed real-time algorithm is designed to identify the horizon at any angle and irrespective of objects appearing close to and/or occluding the horizon line (for e.g. trees, vehicles at a distance) by accounting for its non-linear nature. We use a simple two-stage hierarchical methodology, leveraging color-based features, to quickly isolate the region of the image containing the horizon and then perform a more ne-grained horizon detection operation.

Given the calibration estimates for these parameters, we derive a state estimator where the state prediction of the indirect Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is driven by a MAV model. Solely using measurements from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a barometric pressure sensor - both available on almost every MAV - our model-based formulation keeps the estimated velocity of the MAV bounded in all directions, as opposed to state of the art IMU-model driven state estimators onboard MAVs.

Optimal trajectory generation is a major part of Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) design and if it is robust relative to uncertainties can improve vehicle reliability, safety and operational cost. This paper presents a combination of Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in order to create an appropriate trajectory metamodel for reducing computational time of robust trajectory design optimization of a two-stage-to-orbit SLV. The sampled data of LHS is then used as training data for ELM. Complex and costly uncertainty analyses are replaced by an ELM Neural Network (NN) which is used to instantaneously estimate the mean and standard deviation of objective function and constraints. The evolutionary genetic algorithm is used for global optimization of layers' connection weights and biases to minimize the learning error during learning phase of NN. A Hybrid Search Algorithm (HSA), which associates Simulated Annealing (SA) as a global optimizer with Simplex as a local optimizer is employed to find robust optimum point of this metamodel. The optimal and robust trajectories are compared.

On the other hand, module-based architectures using middlewares are popular in the integration phase, when developing robot systems. To elaborate the behaviors of realtime control modules, IEC61499 function blocks derived from PLC languages is useful. Therefore, in this paper, we combine them and present a development process consisting of system design in SysML, elaboration in function blocks and integration using RTMSafety, which is an implementation of RT-middleware for the use of safety-related systems.

Affiliated app stores offer thousands of different applications (so called apps) for nearly any imaginable purpose. From a software developer's point of view these app stores provide high potential: developers have the chance to reach the general public, thus having a much broader audience than with any other channel of distribution. Nevertheless, the increased amount of potential customers also increases expectations related to user experience. The user interface as the main interaction hub in mobile environments attracts a lot more attention. The success or failure of an app is often related to its user interface. Furthermore, users often demand the same user experience on different platforms. In order to allow for high quality in user interface development and to enable development for different platforms, a framework is presented that provides a platform independent definition of a user interface backed by constraints in form of rules. Using model driven development, the framework allows the creation of user interfaces that are not related to a specific target technology. Furthermore, it provides the ability to define a user interface and transform it into a destination user interface, whether this will be Android, iPhone or Windows Phone 7, with respect to given rules. © 2013 IEEE."

The challenge of processing large amount of data, within an acceptable performance, is solved by employing embedded systems that incorporate complementary attributes of CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), i.e., sequential and parallel execution models.component-based development (CBD) is a software engineering methodology that augments the applications development through reuse of software blocks known as components. In developing a CPU-GPU embedded application using CBD, allocation of components to different processing units of the platform is an important activity which can affect the overall performance of the system. In this context, there is also often the need to support and achieve run-time component allocation due to various factors and situations that can happen during system execution, such as switching off parts of the system for energy saving. In this paper, we provide a solution that dynamically allocates components using various system information such as the available resources (e.g., available GPU memory) and the software behavior (e.g., in terms of GPU memory usage). The novelty of our work is a formal allocation model that considers GPU system characteristics computed on-the-fly through software monitoring solutions. For the presentation and validation of our solution, we utilize an existing underwater robot demonstrator."

Formal verification can be applied to establish functional correctness, but its scalability is limited due to the sheer complexity of a modern automotive system. To manage high complexity and limited development resources, one alternative is to apply runtime monitoring techniques to detect when the system transitions into an unsafe state (i.e., one where it violates a critical safety requirement). In this paper, we report on our experience integrating runtime monitoring into a development workflow and present practical design considerations on languages and tools from an industrial perspective. Using signal temporal logic (STL) [12] and the Breach [6] monitoring tool, we perform a case study showing how monitoring can be used to detect undesirable interactions between two ADAS features called Cooperative Pile-up Mitigation System (CPMS) and False-Start Prevention System (FPS). This is an initial step to utilize runtime monitoring to achieve high assurance in the design of intelligent vehicles."

Consequently, self-adaptive software requires practical runtime verification and validation. We propose an approach for runtime verification of self-adaptive software by using a designed transition system model. The proposed approach consists of two phases: pre-computing phase and runtime phase. In the precomputing phase, we assume that the self-adaptive software is designed as a transition system. In this phase, the proposed approach translates the designed transition system into equations for runtime verification. For translation, we suggest an algorithm based on state elimination and reachability. After the pre-computing phase, the results of the translated equations are verified in the runtime phase. In order to demonstrate the suitability of our proposed approach, we performed experiments to evaluate the performance of the pre-processing phase and the runtime phase. In comparison with other model-checking tools, our approach achieved excellent results."

Real-time obstacle avoidance is one of hot spots of the research. Runtime verification is a real-time and lightweight verification technology to verify the properties in many fields. In this case study, we use the JavaMOP, a runtime verification tool to verify the implementations' correctness of the safety strategies for avoiding collision as a complement to the design. The design of the safety strategies can be classified as the pre-contact safety strategy and the post-contact safety strategy. The former can avoid obstacles and the latter can reduce the physical damage after a collision. Additionally, this case study also proposes a new method of dynamic parameter selection. It can automatically update the parameters during the operation of the robot without having to get familiar with and to modify robot programs. Because some special parameters may change as mutative factors or be updated by engineers' experience in the uncertain environment, they cannot be fixed. We follow the JavaMOP specification to describe informal requirements using the FSM and ptLTL languages. Finally, the experimental results verify the correctness of the safety strategies and the effectiveness of dynamic parameter selection."

Given our tendency to anthropomorphize, incorporating gender cues into a robot's design can influence acceptance by humans. However, little is known about the interaction between human and robot gender. We focus on the role of gender in eliciting negative, ''uncanny"" reactions from observers. We create a corpus of YouTube videos featuring robots with female, male and no gender cues. Our experiment is grounded in Gray and Wegner's (2012) model, which holds that uncanny reactions are driven by the perception of robot agency (i.e., ability to plan and control) and experience (i.e., ability to feel), which in turn, is driven by robot appearance and behavior. Participants watched videos and completed questionnaires to gauge perceptions of robots as well as affective reactions. We used Structural Equation Modeling to test whether the model explains reactions of both men and women. For gender-neutral robots, it does. However, we find a salient human-robot gender interaction. Men's uncanny reactions to robots with female cues are best predicted by the perception of experience, while women's negativity toward masculine robots is driven by perceived agency. The result is interpreted in light of the ''Big Two"" dimensions of person perception, which underlie expectations for women to be warm and men to be agentic. When a robot meets these expectations, it increases the chances of an uncanny reaction in the other-gender observer."

In particular, critical X-by-wire functions require sophisticated redundancy solutions. As a result, the overall Electric/Electronic (E/E) architecture of a vehicle is becoming even more complex and costly. The SafeAdapt project provides an integrated approach for engineering such adaptive, complex and safe systems, ranging from tool chain support, reference architectures, system modeling and networking, up to early validation and verification. In this paper, we give an overview of the SafeAdapt project methodology. We also describe a particular aspect of the project which is the validation of the system adaptive behavior. To validate the adaptive behavior of a vehicle system, an architecture description language for automotive embedded systems (i.e. EAST-ADL) is used for designing the system. The system design model is then used for generating the embedded software. To ensure that the system behaves correctly at runtime, its adaptive behavior is analyzed using fault injection and monitoring techniques on a virtual platform."

In practice, inspections are one of the primary vehicles for ensuring that safety requirements are satisfied by the design. Unless the safety-related aspects of the design are clearly delineated, the inspections conducted by safety assessors would have to consider the entire design, although only small fragments of the design may be related to safety. In a model-driven development context, this means that the assessors have to browse through large models, understand them, and identify the safety-related fragments. This is time-consuming and error-prone, specially noting that the assessors are often third-party regulatory bodies who were not involved in the design. To address this problem, we describe in this paper a prototype tool called, SafeSlice, that enables one to automatically extract the safety-related slices (fragments) of design models. The main enabler for our slicing technique is the traceability between the safety requirements and the design, established by following a structured design methodology that we propose. Our work is grounded on SysML, which is being increasingly used for expressing the design of safety-critical systems.

To achieve the required safety levels the perception system needs to be certified, but no specific standards exist for computer vision systems, and the concept of safe vision systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper we present a novel domain-specific language that allows the programmer to express image quality detection rules for enforcing safety constraints. The language allows developers to increase trustworthiness in the robot perception system, which we argue would increase compliance with safety standards. We demonstrate the usage of the language to improve reliability in a perception pipeline, thus allowing the vision expert to concisely express the safety-related constraints and thereby bridging the gap between domain experts and certification authorities."

First, the generic models and safety requirements described in International Electrotechnical Commission Standard 61375 are formalized as time automata and timed computation tree logic formulas, respectively. With model checking tool Uppaal, we verify whether or not the constructed timed automata satisfy the formulas and several logic inconsistencies in the original standard are detected and corrected. Then, we apply the code generation tool Times to generate C code from the verified model, which is later synthesized into a real MVBC chip, with some handwriting glue code. Furthermore, the runtime verification tool RMOR is applied on the integrated code, to verify some safety requirements that cannot be formalized on the timed automata. For evaluation, we compare the proposed approach with existing MVBC design methods, such as BeagleBone, Galsblock, and Simulink. Experiments show that more ambiguousness or bugs in the standard are detected during Uppaal verification, and the generated code of Times outperforms the C code generated by others in terms of the synthesized binary code size. The errors in the standard have been confirmed and the resulting MVBC has been deployed in the real train communication network."

We express the temporal logic specification as a deterministic, finite automaton (the specification automaton), and link the automaton's discrete transitions to the continuous system state as it passes through specified regions. The optimal hybrid controller is characterized by a set of coupled partial differential equations. Because these equations are difficult to solve exactly in practice in all cases, we propose instead a sampling based technique to solve for an approximate controller through approximate value iteration. We adopt model reference adaptive search-an importance sampling optimization algorithm- to determine the mixing weights of the approximate value function expressed in a finite basis. Under mild technical assumptions, the algorithm converges, with probability one, to an optimal weight that ensures the satisfaction of temporal logic constraints, while minimizing an upper bound for the optimal cost. We demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the method through numerical experiments, including temporal logic planning for a linear system, and a nonlinear mobile robot."

Robot mobility is captured by transition systems whose states represent regions in the environment that satisfy atomic propositions. Existing planning approaches under global temporal goals rely on graph search techniques applied to a synchronous product automaton constructed among the robots. As the number of robots increases, the state-space of the product automaton grows exponentially and, as a result, graph search techniques become intractable. In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based algorithm that builds incrementally a directed tree that approximates the statespace and transitions of the synchronous product automaton. By approximating the product automaton by a tree rather than representing it explicitly, we require much fewer resources to store it and motion plans can be found by tracing the sequence of parent nodes from the leaves back to the root without the need for sophisticated graph search techniques. This significantly increases scalability of our algorithm compared to existing model-checking methods. We also show that our algorithm is probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal and present numerical experiments that show that it can be used to model-check product automata with billions of states, which was not possible using an o.-the-shelf model checker."

Several studies indeed report an increased job satisfaction by anecdotal evidence. In this paper we address the topic of satisfaction by in-depth analysis of the results of a nationwide survey about software development in Switzerland. We wanted to find out if satisfaction depends on the applied development method, and, more concrete, how satisfaction relates to other elements in the development process, including the use of various practices, and the influences on business, team and software issues. We found that higher satisfaction is reported more by those using Agile development than with plan-driven processes. We explored the different perspectives of developers and those with a management role and found a high consistency of satisfaction between Agile developers and Agile management, and big differences with using working plan-driven methods. We found that certain practices and influences have high correlations to satisfaction, and that collaborative processes are closely related to satisfaction, especially when combined with technical practices. Applying recursive partitioning, we found which elements were most important for satisfaction, and gained insight about how practices and influences work in combination. We also explored the relationship between satisfaction and personal experience with Agile development.

By meticulous observation with a high resolution transmission electron microscope, intensively existing atomic-level superlattice structures were identified and perceived as a result of the coexistence of both chalcocite and chalcocite-M phase in as-obtained Cu2S nanoparticles. Further, 3D ordered self-assemblies of pristine Cu2S nanoparticles were obtained by introducing the polar solvent, ethanol, into the non-polar colloidal dispersion systems during the post-treatment process, and thereby the double-superlattice (DSL) nanoparticle systems consisted of both atomic- and particle-level superlattice structures were achieved. And as promising photocatalysts, although the photocatalytic activity was influenced mutually by the size, shape, crystallinity, atomic-level superlattice structures of pristine Cu2S nanoparticles and their self-assembling behavior, the novel structured DSL nanoparticle systems finally demonstrated highly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency towards the degradation of methylene blue. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

AI solvers can compute plans for hundreds of simple agents in minutes with suboptimality guarantees, while robotics solutions typically include richer kinodynamic models during planning, but are very slow when many robots and obstacles are taken into account. We combine the advantages of the two methods by using a twostep approach. First, we use and extend AI solvers for a simplified coordination problem. The output is a discrete plan that cannot be executed on real robots. Second, we apply a computationally efficient post-processing step that creates a continuous plan, taking kinodynamic constraints into account. We show examples for ground robots in a warehouse domain and quadrotors that are tasked with formation change."

In this filed, researchers usually construct a semantic feature model of images. However, the feature model can't intuitively and effectively represent the image for complicated images of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To solve this problem, we propose the idea of divide and rule to decompose scene recognition into superpixel segmentation and surface classification. In this process, an adaptive superpixel segmentation method based on UAV metadata is proposed to segment image into superpixel regions with identical surface. Then, multi-features combination and sparse coding semantic feature are used to respectively describe the image complexity and the content of superpixel regions. It's shown that the accuracy of scene recognition reaches 95% in samples of complicated UAV images testifying that our algorithm can recognize scenes in complicated UAV images by rule and line."

High performance and extreme energy effciency are critical for deployments of CNNs, especially in mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles, cameras, and electronic personal assistants. This paper introduces the Sparse CNN (SCNN) accelerator architecture, which improves performance and energy effciency by exploiting the zero-valued weights that stem from network pruning during training and zero-valued activations that arise from the common ReLU operator. Specifcally, SCNN employs a novel dataflow that enables maintaining the sparse weights and activations in a compressed encoding, which eliminates unnecessary data transfers and reduces storage requirements. Furthermore, the SCNN dataflow facilitates effcient delivery of those weights and activations to a multiplier array, where they are extensively reused; product accumulation is performed in a novel accumulator array. On contemporary neural networks, SCNN can improve both performance and energy by a factor of 2.7× and 2.3×, respectively, over a comparably provisioned dense CNN accelerator."

Although DDS was not intended for embedded systems with limited resources as found in WSN, the authors of this paper propose an approach for a customisable DDS implementation (sDDS) using an model-driven software-development process to tailor the middleware functionality on an individual node level. In this paper, the platform-abstraction layer of sDDS, the platforms supported so far and the effort needed for the porting process are presented. With this approach, it was possible to port sDDS to different platforms, like Contiki, RIOT-OS, FreeRTOS and self-contained ZigBee stack implementations."

Specifically, the search engine assists the information dissemination for social networks, i.e., enabling users to access interested contents with keywords-searching and promoting the process of contents-transferring from the source users directly to potential interested users. Accompanying such processes, the social network evolves as new links emerge between users with common interests. However, there is no clear understanding of such a ""chicken-and-egg"" problem, namely, new links encourage more social interactions, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively characterize the social network evolution phenomenon driven by a search engine. First, we propose a search network model for social network evolution. Second, we adopt two performance metrics, namely, degree distribution and network diameter. Theoretically, we prove that the degree distribution follows an intensified power-law, and the network diameter shrinks. Third, we quantitatively show that the search engine accelerates the rumor propagation in social networks. Finally, based on four real-world data sets (i.e., CDBLP, Facebook, Weibo, and P2P), we verify our theoretical findings. Furthermore, we find that the search engine dramatically increases the speed of rumor propagation."

For the inference part, we utilize a maximum entropy model which models the conditional distribution over possible locations of the target object given the observations made so far. The model is based on co-occurrences of objects and object attributes in different spatial contexts. The parameters are learned by maximizing the data likelihood using gradient ascent.

Network connectivity exposes these vulnerable systems to remote software attacks that can result in real-world physical damage, including vehicle crashes and loss of control authority. We introduce an integrated architecture to provide provable security and safety assurance for cyber-physical systems by ensuring that safety-critical operations and control cannot be unintentionally affected by potentially malicious parts of the system. Fine-grained information flow control is used to design both hardware and software, determining how low-integrity information can affect high-integrity control decisions.

It allows vehicles to travel in a convoy manner, very close to each other with constant speeds and gaps. It uses Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) as the underlying communication framework. These are a type of network with a set of very specific characteristics, making it an easy target for attackers. Frequent disconnections, topology change, communication over the air among others, create vulnerabilities easily exploitable. The goal of this paper is to present how to secure the communication between the several nodes of a platooningby using an existing security model. After a careful research and evaluation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network Public Key Infrastructure and Attribute Based Encryption with Identity Manager Hybrid (VPKIbrID) model was chosen. It provides a whole solution with tools for secure message exchange and entity authentication. The impact of the introduced security model was evaluated using simulations with different platoon sizes and VPKIbrID modes. The several operations of the platoon will be carried using the Platoon Management Protocol (PMP). The result analysis allowed to verify that when using a VPKIbrID mode that allows multicast/broadcast communications, the vehicles sent much fewer messages than the mode that only supports unicast. The performance results indicate that the vehicles should use VPKIbrid Public Key Infrastructure (VPKIbrID-PKI) for maneuvers and VPKIbrid Attribute Base Encryption (VPKIbrID-ABE) to exchange platoon beacons or any message exchanged to all platoon members. Moreover, the messages broadcasted in a platoon group will always have the same targets, with the same attributes, being a perfect use case for the usages of cached keys."

Emerging non-volatile memory technologies integrated in the so called Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architectures enable the realization of such computational paradigms. These architectures take advantage of the Network-on-Chip concept to efficiently carry out communications with dedicated distributed memories and processing elements. However, current MPSoC-based neuromorphic architectures are deployed without taking security into account. The growing complexity and the hyper-sharing of hardware resources of MPSoCs may become a threat, thus increasing the risk of malware infections and Trojans introduced at design time. Specially, MPSoC microarchitectural side-channels and fault injection attacks can be exploited to leak sensitive information and to cause malfunctions. In this work we present three contributions to that issue: i) first analysis of security issues in MPSoC-based neuromorphic architectures; ii) discussion of the threat model of the neuromorphic architectures; ii) demonstration of the correlation between SNN input and the neural computation."

Differing from previous works, in this article, we aim to distinguish between faults and attacks and develop an attack detection algorithm for the latter only. To do this, we note that there are two kinds of faults-transient and permanent; the former are benign and short-lived, whereas the latter may have dangerous consequences on system performance. We argue that sensors have an underlying transient fault model that quantifies the amount of time in which transient faults can occur. In addition, we provide a framework for developing such a model if it is not provided by manufacturers. Attacks can manifest as either transient or permanent faults depending on the attacker's goal.We provide different techniques for handling each kind. For the former, we analyze the worst-case performance of sensor fusion over time given each sensor's transient fault model and develop a filtered fusion interval that is guaranteed to contain the true value and is bounded in size. To deal with attacks that do not comply with sensors' transient fault models, we propose a sound attack detection algorithm based on pairwise inconsistencies between sensor measurements.

Our approach is based on the following principles: (i) the MDE tool is invoked as part of the metaprogram evaluation; (ii) instead of generating code, the MDE tool generates source fragments as abstract syntax trees (ASTs); (iii) the generated source fragments are directly inserted into the main program source through generator macros of the metaprogram; and (iv) the resulting program that incorporates both model code and custom application code can be normally compiled to produce the final application. Using this methodology, the metaprogram practically operates as an interactive editor for the program itself. We assess the validity of our approach with proof-of-concept case studies where all MDE deployment is performed through metaprogramming. Copyright © 2013 ACM."

The policy framework is based on a stable description of software models and proprieties. 3) It can decompose the application into several architectural units to allow developers to decide which part of the architecture should be notified when a specific context condition occurs. © 2011 IEEE.

They often operate in dynamic environments in which unpredictable events may occur at any time. These events may affect the safe operation of vehicles, calling for highly efficient control software technologies to reason about and react on their appearance. A crucial efficiency parameter is timeliness as vehicles often operate under high speed. The contribution of this paper is the presentation and analysis of design aspects of dynamic control software in the context of an autonomous train experiment. This is achieved through a self-adaptation software framework intended for autonomous trains and built on a demonstrator using Lego Mindstorms. The main mission of the framework is to collect context information, reason about it, and adapt the train behavior accordingly. The adaptation framework is implemented using the development tool Reactive Blocks and tested on the demonstrator. The evaluation results provide useful insights into the performance of the framework, particularly about the time needed to reason about the context and to carry out reconfigurations."

In this approach, PCM-based memory storage can be used as working memory and mass storage layers simultaneously, and a self-adaptive data filtering module composed of small DRAM dual buffers was designed to improve unfavorable PCM features, such as asymmetric read/write access latencies and limited endurance and enhance spatial/temporal localities. In particular, the self-adaptive data filtering algorithm enhances data reusability by screening potentially high reusable data and predicting adequate lifetime of those data depending on current victim time decision value. We also propose the possibility that a small amount of DRAM buffer is embedded into mobile processors, keeping this as small as possible for cost effectiveness and energy efficiency. Experimental results show that by exploiting a small amount of DRAM space for dual buffers and using the self-adaptive filtering algorithm to manage them, the proposed system can reduce execution time by a factor of 1.9 compared to the unified conventional model with same the DRAM capacity and can be considered comparable to 1.5× DRAM capacity."

The latter is a safety critical IoT system based on collecting and analyzing the real-time data to perform proper actuation. In order to engineer such a high quality IoT application, a proper software architecture should be designed. In order for the software architecture to be able to optimize critical requirements such as fault-tolerance, performance and energy consumption, it ought to: i) adapt itself to real-time environment transformation, ii) be designed in a proper level of elements distribution. In this paper, we critically analyze a set of IoT distribution and self-adaptation patterns to identify their suitable architectural combinations. Further, we use our IoT modeling framework (CAPS) to model an emergency handling system. Based on these, we design two quality driven architectures to be used for a forest monitoring and evacuation example and qualitatively evaluate and compare them."

As this kind of system needs to modify its behavior during execution, this can be achieved by means of high-level model interventions. The objective of this article is to present relevant approaches of self-Adaptive systems driven by runtime models. This article can help practitioners to get an overall picture of current approaches, in terms of methods, techniques and tools. Researchers can also be inspired to create new or to extend current approaches, facing the challenges identified here.

In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects.

In classical model-driven UI development (MDUID) approaches, self-adaptivity and context management introduce additional complexity since self-adaptation features are distributed in a crosscutting manner at various locations in the models. This results in a tightly interwoven model landscape that is hard to understand and maintain. In this paper, we present an integrated model-driven development method where a classical model-driven development of UIs is coupled with a separate model-driven development of UI adaptation rules and context-of-use. We base our approach on the core UI modeling language IFML, and focus on a new modeling language for adaptation rules, called AdaptUI. We show how generated UI code is coupled with adaptation services generated from AdaptUI adaptation rules and integrated in an overall UI framework. This allows runtime UI adaptation realized by an automatic reaction to context-of-use changes. The benefit of our approach is demonstrated by a case study, showing the development of selfadaptive UIs for a university library application, utilizing the Angular 2 JavaScript framework."

Consequently, their design and realization focus on different domain aspects and require different modeling and engineering techniques.

This analysis is facilitated by the adoption of closed-form solutions for self-calibration from previous work of the authors. It is also show that estimation of the fundamental matrix associated with a stereo head image pair is improved when a domain-specific parameterization and associated computational techniques are adopted. Experiments conducted with such image pairs suggest that, given cognisance of sensitive configurations and adoption of the revised method of fundamental matrix estimation, robust reconstructions are attainable. This is demonstrated on the problem of metrically reconstructing a scene front two pairs of images obtained by an uncalibrated stereo head undergoing unknown ground-plane motion."

As already reported in several articles, self-consistency implies correlations between the return disturbances. As a consequence, the alphas and betas of the factor model are unobservable. Self-consistency leads to renormalized betas with zero effective alphas, which are observable with standard OLS regressions. When the conditions derived from internal consistency are not met, the model is necessarily incomplete, which means that some sources of risk cannot be replicated (or hedged) by a portfolio of stocks traded on the market, even for infinite economies. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations show that, for arbitrary choices of the proxy which are different from the true market portfolio, a modified linear regression holds with a non-zero value αi at the origin between an asset i's return and the proxy's return. Self-consistency also introduces ""orthogonality"" and ""normality"" conditions linking the betas, alphas (as well as the residuals) and the weights of the proxy portfolio. Two diagnostics based on these orthogonality and normality conditions are implemented on a basket of 323 assets which have been components of the S&P500 in the period from January 1990 to February 2005. These two diagnostics show interesting departures from dynamical self-consistency starting about 2 years before the end of the Internet bubble. Assuming that the CAPM holds with the self-consistency condition, the OLS method automatically obeys the resulting orthogonality and normality conditions and therefore provides a simple way to self-consistently assess the parameters of the model by using proxy portfolios made only of the assets which are used in the CAPM regressions. Finally, the factor decomposition with the self-consistency condition derives a risk-factor decomposition in the multi-factor case which is identical to the principal component analysis (PCA), thus providing a direct link between model-driven and data-driven constructions of risk factors. This correspondence shows that PCA will therefore suffer from the same limitations as the CAPM and its multi-factor generalization, namely lack of out-of-sample explanatory power and predictability. In the multi-period context, the self-consistency conditions force the betas to be time-dependent with specific constraints. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Previous studies of possible (magnetostrophic) hydromagnetic instabilities in this regime have been confined to geophysically unrealistic flows and fields. In recent papers we have treated rather general fields and flows in a spherical geometry and in a computationally simple plane-layer model. These studies have highlighted the importance of differential rotation in determining the spatial structure of the instability. Here we have proceeded to use these results to construct a self-consistent dynamo model of the geomagnetic field. An iterative procedure is employed in which an α-effect is calculated from the form of the instability and is then used in a mean field dynamo model. The mean zonal field calculated there is then input back into the hydromagnetic stability problem and a new α-effect calculated. The whole procedure is repeated until the input and output zonal fields are the same to some tolerance. © 1984.

In this work, a new radiation hydrodynamical approach to model line-driven hot-star winds is presented. By coupling a Monte Carlo radiative transfer scheme with a finite volume fluid dynamical method, line-driven mass outflows may be modelled self-consistently, benefiting from the advantages of Monte Carlo techniques in treating multiline effects, such as multiple scatterings, and in dealing with arbitrary multidimensional configurations. In this work, we introduce our approach in detail by highlighting the key numerical techniques and verifying their operation in a number of simplified applications, specifically in a series of self-consistent, one-dimensional, Sobolev-type, hot-star wind calculations. The utility and accuracy of our approach are demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with the predictions of various formulations of the so-called CAK theory and by confronting the calculations with modern sophisticated techniques of predicting the wind structure. Using these calculations, we also point out some useful diagnostic capabilities our approach provides. Finally, we discuss some of the current limitations of our method, some possible extensions and potential future applications."

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are very powerful for timeseries signal analysis. Especially, by integrating gates into recurrent units, gated RNNs such as LSTM and GRU are more complexity, and do not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, so can learn very long-term dependencies. However, for use on wearable devices, RNNs must be simplified to reduce resource consumption, including memory usage and computational cost. The proposed model is approximately the same size and burdensome computation as that of a standard RNN, but exhibits explicit properties of the gating mechanism, so it is unaffected by the problem of vanishing gradients. Experimental results on the HAR problem not only demonstrate that the accuracy of our model is superior to that of the standard RNN, and is comparable with that of LSTM and GRU, but the model is low in resource consumption."

However, due to its nature and intent, activity concealing is not disclosed up-front, which puts users at risk. In this paper, we focus on characterization and detection of such techniques, e.g., hiding the app or removing traces, which we call ""self hiding behavior"" (SHB). SHB has not been studied per se - rather it has been reported on only as a byproduct of malware investigations. We address this gap via a study and suite of static analyses targeted at SH in Android apps. Specifically, we present (1) a detailed characterization of SHB, (2) a suite of static analyses to detect such behavior, and (3) a set of detectors that employ SHB to distinguish between benign and malicious apps. We show that SHB ranges from hiding the app's presence or activity to covering an app's traces, e.g., by blocking phone calls/text messages or removing calls and messages from logs. Using our static analysis tools on a large dataset of 9,452 Android apps (benign as well as malicious) we expose the frequency of 12 such SH behaviors. Our approach is effective: it has revealed that malicious apps employ 1.5 SHBs per app on average. Surprisingly, SH behavior is also employed by legitimate (""benign"") apps, which can affect users negatively in multiple ways. When using our approach for separating malicious from benign apps, our approach has high precision and recall (combined F-measure = 87.19%). Our approach is also efficient, with analysis typically taking just 37 seconds per app. We believe that our findings and analysis tool are beneficial to both app marketplaces and end-users."

The criterion used by SLAP to aggregate states from the Kripke structure is based on the analysis of self-loops that occur in the Büchi automaton expressing the property to verify. Our hybrid approach allows on the one hand to use classical emptiness-check algorithms and build the graph on-the-fly, and on the other hand, to have a compact encoding of the state space thanks to the symbolic representation of the aggregates. Our experiments show that this technique often outperforms other existing (hybrid or fully symbolic) approaches. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

This effect can be minimized by reducing the pilot power. However this approach could lead to insufficient indoor coverage, which also causes an increase in mobility events. In this paper, coverage adaptation is proposed for femtocell deployments that uses information on mobility events of passing and indoor users to optimize the femtocell coverage in order to minimize the increase in core network mobility signalling. Different coverage adaptation methods are discussed and it is shown that the proposed mobility event based self-optimization can significantly outperform simpler methods that aim to achieve a constant cell radius. © 2008 IEEE."

In this work we present a self-organized approach that is able to take decisions locally and in a distributed way. Our approach distinguishes between an infrastructure level and a decision level. The middleware processes running on the infrastructure level, which provides services such as routing, data filtering and aggregation. The decision level defines an explicitly and declaratively represented dynamic meta model that provides the semantics for the infrastructure level processes, which support interoperability. Additionally, this level runs processes that design, supervise and control agents on the infrastructure level. The levels coupled together through feedback loop that ensures that relevant changes on the infrastructure level are reflected in the decision level and vice versa. The corresponding reflection principles provide the basis for the implementation of the self-organizing mechanisms that govern the overall system. We distinguish two complementary categories of quality metrics for evaluating self-organizing systems. The first category explores the performance of the algorithm with respect to the target application such as delay, path length and success rate. In the context of self-organizing systems, it is important to evaluate additional kind of metrics that do not depend necessarily on the application rather than on selforganizing characteristics of the algorithm. In this paper we focus on the second type, and particularly on self-organizing properties of the algorithms. © 2012 IEEE."

However, so far, constructive physicalization has only been studied in lab environments with provided datasets. Our qualitative study investigates the construction of personal physicalizations in people's domestic environments over 2-4 weeks. It contributes an understanding of (1) the process of creating personal physicalizations, (2) the types of personal insights facilitated, (3) the integration of selfreflection in the physicalization process, and (4) its benefits and challenges for self-reflection. We found that in constructive personal physicalization, data collection, construction and self-reflections are deeply intertwined. This extends previous models of visualization creation and data-driven self-reflection. We outline how benefits such as reflection through manual construction, personalization, and presence in everyday life can be transferred to a wider set of digital and physical systems."

It has been defined as a complex interactive process involving not only cognitive self-regulation but also motivational self-regulation. An increasing body of knowledge attests that cognitive self-regulation can be taught and that students who use these self-regulatory skills obtain better grades in the content domain to which these skills apply. However, students who self-regulate on one occasion may not self-regulate their studying on another occasion, despite the acknowledged benefits. It is argued that self-regulated learning can be domain-specific or domain-transcending, and that competent performers in a specific domain rely on different types of prior knowledge related to that domain. In this paper a conceptual review on self-regulated learning is offered on. Four major points will be addressed. First, six types of prior knowledge will be described. Second, it is documented that SRL can be a complex, demanding and deliberate activity, but also a simple, habitual and automatic activity. Third, it will be argued that we have covered some ground demonstrating that cognitive self-regulation can be taught. Fourth, motivational self-regulation will be addressed in an attempt to clarify its position in the six component model of self-regulated learning. Finally, our intervention program will be briefly described in an attempt to demonstrate how the various design recommendations given in the previous sections can be put to the test. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main constraints are energy density of the batteries and the engine power required for flight. In this work, we present a nano-sized blimp platform, consisting of a helium balloon and a rotorcraft. Thanks to the lift provided by helium, the blimp requires relatively little energy to remain at a stable altitude. We also introduce the concept of duty-cycling high power actuators, to reduce the energy requirements for hovering even further. With the addition of a solar panel, it is even feasible to sustain tens or hundreds of flight hours in modest lighting conditions (including indoor usage). A functioning 52 gram prototype was thoroughly characterized and its lifetime was measured in different harvesting conditions. Both our system model and the experimental results indicate our proposed platform requires less than 200mW to hover in a self sustainable fashion. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first nano-size UAV for long term hovering with low power requirements."

In the demo, we will show how our middleware framework FACTS helps to alleviate problems in implementation of both system- and application-level code.

Naor derives the optimal threshold strategies for the individual, social planner and monopoly. The optimal threshold imposed by a monopoly is not greater than the socially optimal threshold, which is not greater than the individual?s threshold. Studies show that this triangular relation holds in a more general setup where the utility function is not necessarily linear. Many of these extensions share common features. We point out conditions that imply the aforementioned result, and apply them to a new model motivated by order-driven markets. In the new model, customers choose between joining and balking when they might be forced to abandon the system before service completion, and the expected value of joining depends on the service completion probability, which is not linear in the observed queue size."

We investigate whether driving neuroevolution by promoting a form of selfish behavior, i.e., by optimizing a fitness index that synthesizes the behavior of each agent independent of any other agent, may also result in optimizing global, system-wide properties. We focus on a specific and challenging task, i.e., evolutionary synthesis of agent as car controller for a road traffic scenario. Based on an extensive simulation-based analysis, our results indicate that even by optimizing the behavior of each single agent, the resulting system-wide performance is comparable to the performance resulting from optimizing the behavior of the system as a whole. Furthermore, agents evolved with a fitness promoting selfish behavior appear to lead to a system that is globally more robust with respect to the presence of unskilled agents."

These applications are built upon Virtual Environments (VEs) in which artificial agents act autonomously while interacting in realtime with users. Semantic modelling of a VR environment makes it possible the knowledge-driven access from the description of VEs that simplifies the development of VR applications. It eases the development of these types of applications. Semantic modelling should provide a consistent representation of the following aspects: 1) The simulated world, its structure and the behavior of its entities, 2) Interactions and tasks, that users and agents can perform in the environment, 3) Knowledge items, that autonomous agents can use for decision-making or for communication with users. This paper presents MASCARET, a model-based approach, for the design of semantic VR environments. This approach is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In this approach, UML is used to provide a knowledge-driven access to the semantic contents of the VE and not for code generation, as in classical software development process. Interests of a UML-based approach are that its metamodel covers different views of the semantic modelling: ontology, structure, behaviors, interactions, activities. It is also an extensible language that can be specialized to provide formal operational semantics. We also present how MASCARET can be used to develop content-rich interactive applications that can be deployed over various VR platforms. Finally, we discuss the benefits of such a metamodel-based approach and show how the multi-layer semantic model can be used in different VR applications, in which adaptive behaviors of artificial agents acting within complex environments have to be simulated. © 2012 IEEE."

Secondly, multiple DCNN architectures and semantic segmentation techniques are explored to highlight the challenges associated with implementation as well as the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency associated with the state-of-the-art. Finally, the achieved models are deployed and experimentally validated. Experimental results highlight promising potential with good segmentation accuracies and real-time feasibility.

This setting is relevant for low-resource speech processing, robotics, and human language acquisition research. Here, we study how a visually grounded speech model, trained on images of scenes paired with spoken captions, captures aspects of semantics. We use an external image tagger to generate soft text labels from images, which serve as targets for a neural model that maps untranscribed speech to (semantic) keyword labels. We introduce a newly collected data set of human semantic relevance judgements and an associated task, semantic speech retrieval, where the goal is to search for spoken utterances that are semantically relevant to a given text query. Without seeing any text, the model trained on parallel speech and images achieves a precision of almost 60% on its top ten semantic retrievals. Compared to a supervised model trained on transcriptions, our model matches human judgements better by some measures, especially in retrieving non-verbatim semantic matches. We perform an extensive analysis of the model and its resulting representations."

We suggest a new semantic-oriented approach to correct both semantic and lexical errors, which is also more accurate for especially domain-specific speech error correction.

The increased sophistication of robotic spacecraft has skyrocketed the complexity and cost of its software development and validation. The engineering of autonomous spacecraft software relies on the availability and application of advanced methods and tools that deliver safe concurrent synchronization as well as enable the validation of domainspecific semantic invariants. The software design and certification methodologies applied at NASA do not reach the level of detail of providing guidelines for the development of reliable concurrent software. To achieve effective and safe concurrent interactions as well as guarantee critical domain-specific properties in code, we introduce the notion of a Semantically Enhanced Container (SEC). A SEC is a data structure engineered to deliver the flexibility and usability of the popular ISO C++ Standard Template Library containers, while at the same time it is hand-crafted to guarantee domain-specific policies. We demonstrate the SEC proof-of-concept by presenting a shared nonblocking SEC vector. To eliminate the hazards of the ABA problem (a fundamental problem in lock-free programming), we introduce an innovative library for querying C++ semantic information. Our SEC design aims at providing an effective model for shared data access within the JPL's Mission Data System. Our test results show that the SEC vector delivers significant performance gains (a factor of 3 or more) in contrast to the application of nonblocking synchronization amended with the traditional ABA avoidance scheme. © 2009 IEEE."

The idea of assessing the semantic similarity of concepts by looking at the occurrences and co-occurrences of terms describing them in pages indexed by a search engine can be directly extended to emotions, and to the words expressing them in different languages. The emotional content associated to a particular emotion for a term can thus be estimated using webbased similarity measures, e.g. Confidence, PMI, NGD and PMING, aggregating the distance computed by a model of emotions, e.g. Ekman, Plutchik and Lovheim. Emotions are ranked based on their similarity to the analyzed text, describing each sentence through a vector of values of emotion load, which form the Vector Space Model for the chosen emotion model and similarity measures. The model is tested comparing experimental results to a ground truth in literature. SEMO takes care of both the phases of data collection and data analysis, to produce knowledge to be used in application domains such as social robots, recommender systems, and human-machine interactive systems."

This information is often extracted from a precise map provided in the vehicle. Therefore the road course and the individual lanes are known in advance by using the map and a suitable ego position estimation. However, in some situations such a map may be invalid and therefore unUSAble. This can be a driving area which was never mapped or regions where the map is outdated because the environment has changed. The following paper addresses the problem of building a road model without using a map by only fusing measurements from different sensors mounted on the ego vehicle. As sensor measurements various information like lane markings painted on the ground, the position of other cars or occupancy grids can be used.

We further show important distinctions between computer agents that are perceived to be driven by humans (i.e., avatars) vs. by algorithms (i.e., agents). Our results reveal that, when the emotion expression reflects an intention to cooperate, participants will cooperate more with avatars than with agents; however, when the emotion reflects an intention to compete, participants cooperate just as little with avatars as with agents. Finally, we present first evidence that the way the dilemma is described - or framed - can influence people's decision-making. We discuss implications for the design of autonomous agents that foster cooperation with humans, beyond what game theory predicts in social dilemmas."

In many applications like marketing design, or product launch, etc., corporations often post curated news or feeds on social media in order to steer the users' opinions in a desired way. We call such scenarios as opinion shaping or opinion control whereby a few select users called control users post opinionated messages to drive the others' opinions to reach a given state. In this paper, we propose SmartShape, an opinion control package that jointly selects the control users, as well as computes the optimum rate of control messages, thereby driving the networked opinion dynamics to the desired direction. Furthermore, our proposal also includes a robust shaping suit which makes our control framework resilient to stochastic fluctuations of opinion dynamics, originating from several sources of randomness. Experiments on several synthetic and real datasets gathered from Twitter, show that SmartShape can accurately determine the quality of a set of control users as well as shape the opinion dynamics more effectively than several baselines."

Published by Elsevier B.V.The modern automotive market is heading towards fully automated self-driving cars. Following this evolution, the amount of new assistance features for ensuring safe and reliable operations is rising, thus the design and verification of electric/electronic systems is becoming more and more complex. Simulation-based verification is key nowadays to test the reliability of a system, since the costs for physical tests cannot be handled anymore. Current tools and design flows hit the limits of complexity and therefore are not capable to efficiently address software and hardware design and optimization in a joint way. Furthermore, the technological, organizational and design gap in today's flows are not covered by current methods and tools. To cope with the high complexity in the integration of embedded systems, the use of advanced methods and design tools is more relevant than ever. In this work, we present a design, simulation and verification framework named SHARC. This framework allows an efficient verification of safety- critical networked embedded systems regarding functional safety (ISO 26262). Moreover, we achieve to merge a simulation-based approach, including virtual prototyping, with quantified reliability analysis without losing consistency."

Different real-time approaches provide traffic managers with varying but valuable information. This paper reviews the literature regarding model-driven and data-driven approaches focusing on short-term realtime traffic prediction. We start by analyzing real-time traffic data collection, referring network state acquisition and description methods which are used as input to predictive algorithms. According to the input variables available, we describe common and useful traffic prediction outputs that should contribute to understand the panorama verified on a road network. We then discuss metrics commonly used to assess prediction accuracy, in order to understand a standardized way to compare the different approaches. We list, detail and compare existing model-driven and data-driven approaches that provide short-term real-time traffic predictions. This research leads to an understanding of the many advantages, disadvantages and trade-offs of the approaches studied and provides useful insights for future development. Despite the predominance of model-driven solutions for the last years, data-driven approaches also present good results suitable for Traffic Management usage."

We build on the basic human motives of self-enhancement and self-verification to propose that the specific self-esteem level of consumers, in the domain relevant for the category, differentially affects their responses to picture type. Specifically, for consumers with low (high) domain-specific self-esteem, depicting a product (person) in the advertisement enhances attitudes toward the advertisement more than depicting a person (product). In two studies, we demonstrate the proposed matching relationships using two different domains of consumer self-evaluation: appearance self-esteem and academic self-esteem. We also show that increased and more fluent generation of self-related mental imagery drives the observed improvement in attitudes toward the advertisement. Our findings suggest direct implications for advertising design. © 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology."

In this paper, we are using two different state-of-the-art proof techniques (explicit bisimulation construction versus borrowed contexts) to show bisimilarity preservation of a given model transformation between two simple (self-defined) languages, both of which are equipped with a graph transformation-based operational semantics. The contrast between these proof techniques is interesting because they are based on different model transformation strategies: triple graph grammars versus in situ transformation.

Task consumption is driven by the selfselection of workers in the most popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower. Workers typically complete tasks one after another in a chain. Prior works have revealed the impact of ordering tasks while considering aspects such as task complexity. However, little is understood about the benefits of considering task similarity in microtask chains. In this paper, we investigate the role of task similarity in microtask crowdsourcing and how it affects market dynamics. We identified different dimensions that affect the perception of task similarity among workers, and propose a supervised machine learning model to predict the overall task similarity of a task pair. Leveraging task similarity, we studied the effects of similarity on worker retention, satisfaction, boredom and fatigue. We reveal the impact of chaining tasks according to their similarity on worker accuracy and their task completion time. Our findings enrich the current understanding of crowd work and bear important implications on structuring workflow."

However, there is a potential performance overhead that, for autonomous robotic and embedded systems, may be critical. Proposals for robotic middleware continue to emerge, but surprisingly, they repeatedly follow the publish-subscriber model. There are several disadvantages to the push paradigm of the publisher-subscriber approach; in particular, its implication of a closer coupling where the subscriber must be active and able to keep up with the pace of events. We propose an alternative pull model, where consumers of messages handle information at their own time. We show that our proposal aligns with fundamental, time-triggered design principles, and produces simple module communication that reduces thread management and can enable rapid prototyping, validation, and formal verification."

This has led to the unsatisfactory situation in which feedback-free parameter selection rules such as the cooling schedule of Simulated Annealing are predominant in state-of-the-art heuristics, while, at the same time, we understand very well that such time-dependent selection rules can not perform as well as adjustment rules that do take into account the evolution of the optimization process. A number of adaptive and self-adaptive parameter control strategies have been proposed in the literature, but did not (yet) make their way to a broader public. A key obstacle seems to lie in their rather complex update rules. The purpose of our work is to demonstrate that high-performing online parameter selection rules do not have to be very complicated. More precisely, we experiment with a multiplicative, comparison-based update rule to adjust the mutation rate of a (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm. We show that this simple self-adjusting rule outperforms the best static unary unbiased black-box algorithm on LeadingOnes, achieving an almost optimal speedup of about 18%. We also observe promising performance on the OneMax benchmark problem."

To achieve this goal, a modified FT finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is proposed in this paper. The dead beat control is used to predict the reference voltage applied by the inverter. A sensitivity analysis is done to show the effect of model uncertainty on the controller performance. In addition, a simple, fast and general open switch and short circuit fault detection (FD) method in voltage source inverter (VSI) is presented. The FD method is capable of detecting open switch, open phase, and short circuit faults without any auxiliary variable. Moreover, it is robust to both speed and load transients in a motor drive. To validate the presented theory, experimental results are conducted on a five-phase BLDC motor drive with outer rotor in wheel structure."

A key step in simulation-driven algorithms is to compute the reach set overapproximations from a set of initial states through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis. This article addresses this problem by providing algorithms for computing discrepancy functions as the upper bound on the sensitivity, that is, the rate at which trajectories starting from neighboring states converge or diverge. The algorithms rely on computing local bounds on matrix measures as the exponential change rate of the discrepancy function. We present two techniques to compute the matrix measures under different norms: regular Euclidean norm or Euclidean norm under coordinate transformation, such that the exponential rate of the discrepancy function, and therefore, the conservativeness of the overapproximation, is locally minimized. The proposed algorithms enable automatic reach set computations of general nonlinear systems and have been successfully used on several challenging benchmark models. All proposed algorithms for computing discrepancy functions give soundness and relative completeness of the overall simulation-driven safety-bounded verification algorithm. We present a series of experiments to illustrate the accuracy and performance of the algorithms."

It is normal to find beginning graduate students who are clueless about how they should conduct their research. Similarly, part of the onus shifts to the academic supervisors too. They are equally oblivious about delivering worthwhile problems and adequate supervision to their students. This position paper is written in this wake. The motive is to highlight important ideas about how good research should be conducted in today's multidisciplinary academic world. A particular intention is to highlight the importance of employing domain-specific simulators for successful research. More specifically, it is argued that in order to conduct good quality research in various scientific and academic disciplines, it is not only important, rather inevitable to employ simulators for conducting cutting-edge research.

Through an intuitive interface, designers first create unique robots by combining different types of servomotors, 3D printable connectors, wheels and feet in a mix-and-match manner. With the resulting robot as input, a novel trajectory optimization formulation generates walking, rolling, gliding and skating motions. These motions emerge naturally based on the components used to design each individual robot. We exploit the particular structure of our formulation and make targeted simplifications to significantly accelerate the underlying numerical solver without compromising quality. This allows designers to interactively choreograph stable, physically-valid motions that are agile and compelling. We furthermore develop a suite of user-guided, semi-automatic, and fully-automatic optimization tools that enable motion-aware edits of the robot's physical structure.

Part of the plan is to establish a number of federally funded research projects which investigate and tackle domain specific problems, e.g. the limited driving range of electric cars. Freight traffic is especially hampered by those range restrictions. The Smart City Logistik (SCL) project strives for a practical and short term solution to this problem in the concrete context set by the city of Erfurt, Germany. The focus is on ICT-support for currently available, small and medium sized, fully electric vehicles that provide for the 'last mile' in freight handling. The idea is to transfer the goods from large trucks with traditional gasoline-driven engines to smaller sized electric transporters, to support this fleet with an integrated online interface to usual logistics systems, and to estimate and manage each individual vehicle's range, itinerary and route with a highly personalized in-car client. This paper provides an overview of ongoing work, as well as a look at specific concepts and structures in the project's layout."

Publication rights licensed to ACM.We address the problem of determining the satisfiability of a Boolean combination of convex constraints over the real numbers, which is common in the context of hybrid system verification and control. We first show that a special type of logic formulas, termed monotone Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) formulas, is the most general class of formulas over Boolean and nonlinear real predicates that reduce to convex programs for any satisfying assignment of the Boolean variables. For this class of formulas, we develop a new satisfiability modulo convex optimization procedure that uses a lazy combination of SAT solving and convex programming to provide a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. Our approach can then leverage the efficiency and the formal guarantees of state-of-the-art algorithms in both the Boolean and convex analysis domains. A key step in lazy satisfiability solving is the generation of succinct infeasibility proofs that can support conflict-driven learning and decrease the number of iterations between the SAT and the theory solver. For this purpose, we propose a suite of algorithms that can trade complexity with the minimality of the generated infeasibility certificates. Remarkably, we show that a minimal infeasibility certificate can be generated by simply solving one convex program for a sub-class of SMC formulas, namely ordered positive unate SMC formulas, that have additional monotonicity properties. Perhaps surprisingly, ordered positive unate formulas appear themselves very frequently in a variety of practical applications. By exploiting the properties of monotone SMC formulas, we can then build and demonstrate effective and scalable decision procedures for problems in hybrid system verification and control, including secure state estimation and robotic motion planning."

This paper presents a UML profile for Service-Oriented DERTS development by defining the stereotypes, along with the associated meta-model and constraints.

At the core of the architecture lies a novel stochastic decision-making mechanism that implements a partially observable Markov decision process anticipating a humans state of mind in two-stages. In the first stage it anticipates the humans task related availability, intent (motivation), and capability during the collaboration. In the second, it further reasons about these states to anticipate the humans true need for help. Our contribution lies in the ability of our model to handle these unexpected conditions: 1) when the humans intention is estimated to be irrelevant to the assigned task and may be unknown to the robot, e.g., motivation is lost, another assignment is received, onset of tiredness, and 2) when the humans intention is relevant but the human doesnt want the robots assistance in the given context, e.g., because of the humans changing emotional states or the humans task-relevant distrust for the robot. Our results show that integrating this model into a robots decision-making process increases the efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration."

Interactive robots that provide services in a public space, such as handing out flyers or touting, have been developed. To provide such services, robot behavior must be appropriate, i.e., comparable to that of a human. Such appropriate behavior is based on social common sense, which is a human concept. However, modeling social common sense when a human provides a service in public space is difficult. This paper focuses on a service, e.g., handing out flyers, provided by a robot to customers waiting in a queue where the order of the queue is unclear. By modeling the unconscious order of the queue as social common sense, we develop a robot that can provide a service in an appropriate order. To model the unconscious order of the queue, the human order is defined by the geometric relationship between a human and a robot and the queue order that an individual recognizes. Through an experiment conducted in a public space, we confirm that the robot with the modeled common sense hands out flyers to customers in an appropriate order. In addition, the robot can give advice to a customer who cuts into the line."

Existing frameworks for generating intent-expressive robot behaviors have typically focused on applications in static or structured environments. Under such settings, emphasis is placed towards communicating the robots intended final configuration to other agents. However, in dynamic, unstructured and multi-agent domains, such as pedestrian environments, knowledge of the robots final configuration is not sufficiently informative as it completely ignores the complex dynamics of interaction among agents. To address this problem, we design a planning framework that aims at generating motion that clearly communicates an agents intended collision avoidance strategy rather than its destination. Our framework estimates the most likely intended avoidance protocols of others based on their past behaviors, superimposes them, and generates an expressive and socially compliant robot action that reinforces the expectations of others regarding these avoidance protocols. This action facilitates inference and decision making for everyone, as illustrated in the simplified topological pattern of agents trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves significantly lower topological complexity, compared against common benchmark approaches in multi-agent collision avoidance. The significance of this result for real world applications is demonstrated by a user study that reveals statistical evidence suggesting that multi-agent trajectories of lower topological complexity tend to facilitate inference for observers."

All rights reserved.The belief-desire-intention (BDI) model is one of the most widely used for developing agents. One of its benefits is the flexibility of choosing among different plans to achieve a goal and, to leverage this benefit, a particular algorithm that makes this choice must be selected. Although many techniques have been proposed addressing the plan selection process - as well as other aspects of BDI agents - they require many customisations and adaptations to be used in particular applications, thus requiring expert knowledge to be adopted, which is a real barrier to the large-scale adoption of this kind of agent technology. We thus in this paper propose a model-driven approach that allows modelling agents based on an extended BDI model (inspired by the Tropos meta-model) and automatically generating source code that implements agents with the ability of selecting plans. As this plan selection process typically involves analysing plan side effects, e.g. cost of execution, in the context of current agent preferences, our approach uses a preference-based plan selection process over what we refer to as softgoals. This process relies on the multi-attribute utility theory, taking into account the uncertainty of plan outcomes. We evaluate our approach experimentally."

First, we propose a software agent platform that integrates in agent specification's the notions of Belief-Desire-Intention agent architecture with functionalities of process-aware information systems. The platform enables organizations to negotiate collaborations agreements in electronic format to establish dynamic inter-organizational collaborations and define the collaborative processes to be executed. Second, we propose a methodology that includes methods based on Model-Driven Development, which enable the generation of executable process models and the code of process-oriented agents, derived from conceptual models of collaborative processes. This methodology and methods are implemented and automated by software agents that enable the generations of these implementation artifacts, at run-time of the platform. Therefore, the platform enables the automatic generation of the technology solution that requires each organization to execute the agreed collaborative processes, where the generated artifacts are built and initialized in the platform, allowing the implementation and execution of these processes. In this way, the proposed agent-based platform allows to establish collaboration among heterogeneous and autonomous organizations focusing in the process-oriented integration. © 2003-2012 IEEE."

Research Method We have used Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) method for identifying and analyzing 56 peer-reviewed papers. Our review has (i) taxonomically classified the existing research and (ii) systematically mapped the solutions, frameworks, notations and evaluation methods to highlight the role of software architecture in robotic systems. Results and Conclusions We have identified eight themes that support architectural solutions to enable (i) operations, (ii) evolution and (iii) development specific activities of robotic software. The research in this area has progressed from object-oriented to component-based and now to service-driven robotics representing different architectural models that emerged overtime. An emerging solution is cloud robotics that exploits the foundations of service-driven architectures to support an interconnected web of robots.

Therefore, in this contribution a concept for a compact course is introduced which includes the main topics of software engineering and focuses on the software development skills which are usually expected from an engineer. The course is based on software modeling using UML, deployment of design patterns, code generation especially for embedded systems and using model driven architecture principles. This basic knowledge is applied to a programming project in robotics. Starting with a Lego NXT robot - without Lego software- the ARM 7 processor is addressed directly by the developed software. Beginning with a Platform Independent Model, the students design the system in UML using an appropriate tool. A Transformation Description Model and a Platform Description Model are provided so that the executable system can be generated.

A real-world robot control system is composed of tens of software components. For each component providing robotic functionality, tens of different implementations may be available. The difficult challenge in robotic system engineering consists in selecting a coherent set of components, which provide the functionality required by the application requirements, taking into account their mutual dependencies. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that robotics system integrators and application developers are usually not specifically trained in software engineering. In various application domains, software product line (SPL) development has proven to be the most effective approach to face this kind of challenges. In a previous paper [D. Brugali and N. Hochgeschwender, Managing the functional variability of robotic perception systems, in First IEEE Int. Conf. Robotic Computing, 2017, pp. 277-283.] we have presented a model-based approach to the development of SPL for robotic perception systems, which integrates two modeling technologies developed by the authors: The HyperFlex toolkit [L. Gherardi and D. Brugali, Modeling and reusing robotic software architectures: The HyperFlex toolchain, in IEEE Int. Conf.

We show that a distributed meta level architecture is particularly suited for the implementation of such a self-organizing grid of services. This architecture (SOGOS) distinguishes between an object level and a meta level. The middleware processes of the grid are running on the object level. The meta level defines an explicitly and declaratively represented dynamic meta model that provides the semantics for the object level processes. Additionally, this level runs processes that plan, supervise and control mobile agents on the object level. The levels are linked together by reflection processes that ensure that relevant changes on the object level are reflected in the meta model and vice versa. The corresponding reflection principles provide the basis for the implementation of the self-organizing mechanisms that govern the overall system. © 2006 IEEE."

Although full automation is not yet a reality there has been significant research on the impacts of self-driving vehicles on traffic flows, mainly on interurban roads. However, little attention has been given to what could happen to urban mobility when all vehicles are automated. In this paper we propose a new method to study how replacing privately owned conventional vehicles with automated ones affects traffic delays and parking demand in a city. The model solves what we designate as the User Optimum Privately Owned Automated Vehicles Assignment Problem (UO-POAVAP), which dynamically assigns family trips in their automated vehicles in an urban road network from a user equilibrium perspective where, in equilibrium, households with similar trips should have similar transport costs. Automation allows a vehicle to travel without passengers to satisfy multiple household trips and, if needed, to park itself in any of the network nodes to benefit from lower parking charges. Nonetheless, the empty trips can also represent added congestion in the network. The model was applied to a case study based on the city of Delft, the Netherlands. Several experiments were done, comparing scenarios where parking policies and value of travel time (VTT) are changed. The model shows good equilibrium convergence with a small difference between the general costs of traveling for similar families. We were able to conclude that vehicle automation reduces generalized transport costs, satisfies more trips by car and is associated with increased traffic congestion because empty vehicles have to be relocated. It is possible for a city to charge for all street parking and create free central parking lots that will keep total transport costs the same, or reduce them. However, this will add to congestion as traffic competes to access those central nodes. In a scenario where a lower VTT is experienced by the travelers, because of the added comfort of vehicle automation, the car mode share increases. Nevertheless this may help to reduce traffic congestion because some vehicles will reroute to satisfy trips which previously were not cost efficient to be done by car. Placing the free parking in the outskirts is less attractive due to the extra kilometers but with a lower VTT the same private vehicle demand would be attended with the advantage of freeing space in the city center."

Cross-functionality is also supposed to produce cross-fertilization: Better ideas and solutions, problems prevented or detected earlier, etc. Question: What is motivating or demotivating team members to work in a cross-functional manner? Method: We conceptualize observations from five agile teams (work observations, interviews, group discussion) and from interviews with five agile consultants/coaches by applying Grounded Theory Methodology. Results: The inclination to interact cross functionally is moderated by at least six factors such as perceived inefficiency, a sense of responsibility for one's own functional domain, or the difficulty to find a level of detail that is suitable for the collaboration. Conclusion: Cross-fertilization is harder to get than one might expect and teams need to develop good judgment to succeed at it."

It uses music-understanding technologies to dynamically synthesize music-driven multimedia performances from a musical piece of choice. To simultaneously control hundreds of devices, a conventional architecture keeps always-on connections between them. However, it does not scale and suffers from latency and jitter issues when there are various devices with potentially unstable networks. We address this with a novel autonomous control architecture in which each device is notified of forthcoming musical events (e.g., beats and chorus sections) to automatically drive various changes in multimedia performances. Moreover, we provide a development kit of an event-driven multimedia framework for JavaScript, example programs, and an interactive tutorial. To evaluate the platform, we compared latencies, jitters, and amounts of network traffic between ours and the conventional architecture. To examine use cases in the wild, we deployed the platform to drive over a hundred of a variety of devices. We also developed a web browser-based application for a multimedia performance with music playback. It provided audiences of hundreds with a bring-your-own-device experience of synchronized animations on smartphones. In addition, the development kit was used in a two-day hackathon. We report lessons learned from these studies and discuss the future of the Internet of Musical Things."

The topology control and node positioning are challenging for FANET applications, which require the analysis of three dimensional space. Molecular geometry based approaches have been proposed for FANETs to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we propose a spatially adaptive positioning approach for FANETs. We define the collision probabilities for UAV positions and use them with boundary planes among UAVs in three dimensional space to analyze the molecular geometry based approaches and to show their efficiency. Then this analysis is used for the dynamic adaptation of the geometries for spaces with spatial constraints.

Thus, the LFP and neuronal coherence appear to be the result of a common mechanism that underlies neuronal assembly formation. We used the olfactory bulb as a model to investigate: (1) the extent to which unitary dynamics and LFP oscillations can be correlated and (2) the precision with which a model of the hypothesized underlying mechanisms can accurately explain the experimental data. For this purpose, we analyzed simultaneous recordings of mitral cell (MC) activity and LFPs in anesthetized and freely breathing rats in response to odorant stimulation. Spike trains were found to be phase-locked to the gamma oscillation at specific firing rates and to form odor-specific temporal patterns. The use of a conductance-based MC model driven by an approximately balanced excitatory-inhibitory input conductance and a relatively small inhibitory conductance that oscillated at the gamma frequency allowed us to provide one explanation of the experimental data via a mode-locking mechanism. This work sheds light on the way network and intrinsic MC properties participate in the locking of MCs to the gamma oscillation in a realistic physiological context and may result in a particular time-locked assembly. Finally, we discuss how a self-synchronization process with such entrainment properties can explain, under experimental conditions: (1) why the gamma bursts emerge transiently with a maximal amplitude position relative to the stimulus time course; (2) why the oscillations are prominent at a specific gamma frequency; and (3) why the oscillation amplitude depends on specific stimulus properties. We also discuss information processing and functional consequences derived from this mechanism. © 2009 David et al."

Vitamin C has an antioxidant role in organisms by neutralizing the ROS (reactive oxygen species) produced by oxidizing agents and this vitamin has an important function in the male reproductive system. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether vitamin C could prevent or attenuate the alterations in the male reproductive system caused by ethanol consumption. To test this hypothesis, male rats were divided into three experimental groups and treated by gavage for 63 days. The ethanol (E) and ethanol. +. vitamin C (EC) groups received 2. g/kg of ethanol (25%. v/v) daily. In addition to ethanol, the EC group received vitamin C at a dose of 100. mg/day, diluted in water. The control group (C) received only the vehicle. On the 64th experimental day, the animals were anesthetized and euthanized, and blood was collected for plasmatic hormonal analysis. The testis, epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles were removed and weighed. Sperm from the vas deferens was submitted to morphological and motility analysis. The testis and epididymis were used for oxidative stress and histopathological analysis, sperm count, morphometric analysis of the testis, and stereological analysis of the epididymis. The results showed that vitamin C has a protective effect in the testes of adult male rats, entirely normalizing the parameters of sperm count, spermatogenesis kinetics, lipid peroxidation levels, and sperm motility, as well as partially normalizing the histopathological damage in the testis, epididymis, and sperm morphology. Thus, we concluded that lipid peroxidation is a major mechanism by which ethanol affects the testes and sperm, whereas no plasmatic testosterone alterations were found."

More specifically, we focus on two fundamental problems that software developers are faced with: performance portability across the ever-changing landscape of parallel platforms and correctness guarantees for sophisticated floating-point code. The problem is approached as follows: We develop a formal framework to capture computational algorithms, computing platforms, and program transformations of interest, using a unifying mathematical formalism we call operator language (OL). Then we cast the problem of synthesizing highly optimized computational kernels for a given machine as a strongly constrained optimization problem that is solved by search and a multistage rewriting system. Since all rewrite steps are semantics preserving, our approach establishes equivalence between the kernel specification and the synthesized program. This approach is implemented in the SPIRAL system, and we demonstrate it with a selection of computational kernels from the signal and image processing domain, software-defined radio, and robotic vehicle control. Our target platforms range from mobile devices, desktops, and server multicore processors to large-scale high-performance and supercomputing systems, and we demonstrate performance comparable to expertly hand-tuned code across kernels and platforms."

For this reason, we propose a novel approach to food journaling that uses speech and language understanding technology in order to enable efficient self-assessment of energy and nutrient consumption. This paper presents ongoing language understanding experiments conducted as part of a larger effort to create a nutrition dialogue system that automatically extracts food concepts from a user's spoken meal description. We first summarize the data collection and annotation of food descriptions performed via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), for both a written corpus and spoken data from an in-domain speech recognizer. We show that the addition of word vector features improves conditional random field (CRF) performance for semantic tagging of food concepts, achieving an average F1 test score of 92.4 on written data; we also demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) with no hand-crafted features outperforms the best CRF on spoken data, achieving an F1 test score of 91.3. We illustrate two methods for associating foods with properties: Segmenting meal descriptions with a CRF, and a complementary method that directly predicts associations with a feed-forward neural network. Finally, we conduct an end-to-end system evaluation through an AMT user study with worker ratings of 83% semantic tagging accuracy."

It is mainly data-driven and requires only minimally annotated corpus for training whilst retaining the understanding robustness and deepness for spoken language. More importantly, it allows that weakly supervised strategies are employed for training the two kinds of classifiers, which could significantly reduce the number of labeled sentences. We investigated active learning and naive self-training for the two kinds of classifiers. Also, we propose a practical method for bootstrapping topic-dependent slot classifiers from a small amount of labeled sentences. Experiments have been conducted in the context of the Chinese public transportation information inquiry domain and the English DARPA Communicator domain. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed SLU framework and demonstrate the possibility to reduce human labeling efforts significantly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to IoT devices are often deployed in dynamic and unmanned environment, it is imperative that the IoT devices have automatic model construction capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step approach called synchronous self-paced learning (SSL) for the IoT devices to construct the model automatically. In the first step, we design a synchronous mechanism that makes correlated devices synchronized and obtain the pseudo labels to form the original training set. In the second step, we propose a sample selection method based on reliability and diversity to filter the original training set, based on which we automatically accomplish the model construction. We conduct empirical evaluation of our SSL method compared with three state-of-the-art methods; and the evaluation shows that by applying our SSL method, we can achieve the classifier with higher accuracy."

While most existing work focuses on single-defender sett ings, there are many real-world scenarios that involve multiple defenders (e.g.. multi-national anti-crime actions in international waters, different security agencies patrolling the same area). In this paper, we consider security games with uncoordinated defende rs who jointly protect a set of targets, but may have different valuations for these targets; each defender schedules their own resources and selfishly optimizes their own utility. We generalize the standard (single-defender) model of Stackelberg security games to this setting and formulate an equilibrium concept that captures the nature of strategic interaction among the players. We argue that an exact equilibrium may fail to exist, and, in fact, deciding whether it exists is NP-hard. However, under mild assumptions. every multi-defender security game admits an c-equilibrium for every e > 0, and the limit points corresponding to E -' 0 can be efficiently approximated."

Since it has been designed for low power domestic applications, so the proposed control strategy is designed in a way that it can be implemented without needs of absolute position sensors and current sensors. For position detection, it merely need a simple pair of Infrared transceiver sensor. Initially motor parameters are discussed, then highlighted on the proposed control strategy.

The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as ""designers"" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD.

Although there is such a stereo method using the constraint that a vehicle moves on flat planes, the conventional method has the following drawbacks. First, it lacks of an effective contrivance to deal with camera vibrations and road inclination. Second, there is no measure to assess the danger of detected obstacles. To solve these problems, we develop a domain-specific stereo method which utilizes attributes of roads. We introduce a new camera model that is valid in road scenes in order to simplify the epipolar geometry giving a useful relationship between a pair of images. Furthermore, extraction of two parallel lines marking the driving lane enables us to correctly detect obstacles and even to estimate the degree of the danger. The proposed method is implemented on a Pentium II 450MHz PC and the current operating frequency is 15Hz for 320×240 images without MMX instructions. Through experiments we demonstrate that our method is applicable to a variety of road scenes."

The proposed approach is based on a recognition algorithm driven by a statistical model of the 3D road lane, projected in both stereoscopic images. First, the model is initialized thanks to a training stage. The model is then updated iteratively, from successively extracted image features. After each iteration, the detection of the next features, in any of the two images of the stereoscopic pair, is driven by the features already detected. The parameters of the road lane, such as width, horizontal and vertical curvature, roll, pitch, and yaw angles, are estimated. The variance of each parameter is also estimated, and is minimized through the estimation process. Unlike previous proposed approaches, no disparity map is required : the matching of the image features is directly obtained as a result of the model update. Thus, computing time is low. Experiments from computer-generated and real images are carried out to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the method. © 2008 IEEE."

Driven by concepts from pedestrian dynamics, in a particular regime known as stop-and-go waves, we propose a particular single-biased random walk (SBRW). This setup is modeled both via partial differential equations (PDE) and by using a probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) method. The problem is non-interacting until the opposite particles visit the same cell of the target particles, which generates delays on the crossing time that depends on the concentration of particles of opposite species per cell. We analyzed the fluctuations on the position of particles and our results show a non-regular propagation characterized by long-tailed and asymmetric distributions which are better fitted by some chromatograph distributions found in the literature. We also show that effects of the crowd of particles in this situation are able to generate a pattern where we observe a small decrease of the target particle dispersion followed by an increase, differently from the observed straightforward non-interacting case. For a particular initial condition we present an interesting solution via constant density approximation (CDA)."

Additionally, the in vivo induction of micronuclei (MN) was studied in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) derived from bone marrow of CDW-treated Wistar rats. Furthermore, we examined the influence of CDW on the lipid peroxidation (LpO) in blood, liver, kidney and testicle of rats. The results demonstrated significant increases of micronucleated PCEs in the bone marrow of rats fed with relatively low CDW doses (33.3ml/kg body weight per day). Similar effects, i.e. increases of MN frequencies, were found in Hep G2 hepatoma cells after CDW treatment (41 MN/1000 binucleated cells (BNCs) for 167ml CDW) in comparison to the vehicle control (24 MN/1000 BNC). Additionally, DNA damages caused by CDW were observed in the comet assay. As a product of LpO, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly enhanced almost in all animals and organs tested after CDW treatment. In livers and serum of rats dose-dependent increases of MDA were observed. The data indicated that extracts from CDW obtained from polluted raw water were able to cause oxidative damages and to induce various biological effects in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro, i.e. clastogenicity and/or aneugenicity, DNA strand breaks and/or alkali-labile damages. The consistency of the results among the various biological systems and endpoints led to the conclusion that the consumption of chlorinated drinking water obtained from polluted raw water may enhance the body burden with mutagenic and/or carcinogenic substances and therefore, means a potential genetic hazard for human health. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V."

The parameters such as a modified scattering feature, bright points ratio and bright grey ratio are obtained from the scattered images. A machine learning technique called support vector regression (SVR) is developed to determine surface roughness. The three features are chosen as input parameters, and surface roughness is selected as output of the SVR model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the optical measurement of surface roughness with a satisfactory accuracy.

Then indicated that there were inherent limitations in model-based method and data-driven method adopted in maintenance decision-making and suggested the Multi-Agents method which is widely applied in many domains may be a proper choice. The components of Maintenance Decision-Making Agent (MDA) were presented in detail. On the analysis of Remaining Life Prediction Agent, Opportunistic Maintenance actions was proposed, which will help to turn the reactive maintenance philosophy to scheduled or preventive maintenance philosophy. It was proved that the capability of cooperation, interaction and parallel processing of autonomous agents had been greatly improved. The Multi-Agents model for maintenance decision-making was more effective in achieving the intelligence of the system. © 2011 IEEE."

This paper proposes the use of super resolution techniques for enhancing topographic data directly. Specifically, a database-driven super resolution algorithm that is trained with domain-specific patterns is used to enhance topographic digital elevation model (DEM) data from NASA/NGIA SRTM. This enhancement process is evaluated using a elevation-difference evaluation technique where downscaled and enhanced DEM data is compared to the origional higher-resolution data. It is also evaluated with a threshold-based elevation difference metric and visually. The benefits that it might have for flight path planning for a UAV application are discussed.

We trialed the intervention with 36 nut allergic adolescents. At 1-year follow-up participants had improved adrenaline auto-injector skills and carriage, disease- and age-specific Quality of Life and confidence in anaphylaxis management. At 3-year follow-up adrenaline carriage improved further and confidence remained higher.

Cloud outages can happen to any provider, as the events of the last years have largely demonstrated, and have a critical impact on the actual reliability of cloud applications. A solution to both problems could be to support application developers and operators in the adoption of a multi-cloud approach: applications are built to run and replicate on different clouds, and mechanisms for fast switching from a cloud installation to the other are offered. In the MODAClouds project we pursue this approach and rely on model-driven development combined with risk analysis and quality prediction.

For abrasive belts, the contact is essentially between the rubber contact wheel and the workpiece surface. This paper investigates the pressure distribution with respect to different applying loads and wheel hardness values for such contact. The study compares pressure data among those measured from experiments and across with those calculated from Hertzian model. To facilitate the analysis, the experimental data in discrete values is fitted into smooth continuous elliptical profiles. In general, the pressure results from experiments and from Hertzian prediction both display similar correlation with the varying load and hardness, although experimental results suggest more significant changes in terms of contact area. Moreover, Herzian model tends to underestimate the contact area while overestimate the pressure values. The model provides better prediction at low applying load and high hardness value, at which it can be implemented as a suitable prediction model for pressure distribution."

Bubalus bubalis) to develop oxidative stress having antigonadotropic and antisteroidogenic actions. Melatonin is a regulator of seasonal reproduction in photoperiodic species and highly effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger. Therefore, a study was designed to evaluate the effect of sustained-release melatonin on biomarkers of oxidative stress i.e., the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the total antioxidant capacity (TAC). For the study, postpartum buffaloes diagnosed as summer anestrus (absence of overt signs of estrus, concurrent rectal examination, and RIA for serum progesterone) were grouped as treated (single subcutaneous injection of melatonin at 18mg/50kg body weight dissolved in sterilized corn oil as vehicle, n=20) and untreated (subcutaneous sterilized corn oil, n=8). Blood sampling for estimation of serum TAC and MDA (mmol/L) and NO (μmol/L) was carried out at 4days of interval from 8days before treatment till 28days after treatment or for the ensuing entire cycle length. Results showed serum TAC concentration was higher in the treatment group with a significant (P<0.05) increasing trend, whereas MDA and NO revealed a significant (P<0.05) decline. Serum MDA and NO were higher in control compared with those of treatment group. Moreover, buffaloes in the treatment group showed 90% estrus induction with 18.06±1.57days mean interval from treatment to the onset of estrus. These results report that melatonin has a protective effect by elevating antioxidant status and reducing oxidative stress resulting in the induction of cyclicity in summer-stressed anestrous buffaloes."

Motivated by this problem, we introduce a new logic called counting linear temporal logic plus (cLTL+). This logic enables specifying multi-agent tasks over possibly infinite horizons in a compact manner. We then propose an optimization-based method that generates trajectories for individual agents that, when implemented together, guarantee the satisfaction of a given cLTL+ formula. In the second part of the paper, we discuss how these results can be extended to generate trajectories that can be asynchronously implemented by the agents while preserving the satisfaction of the desired cLTL+ specification. In particular, we show that when the asynchrony between agent trajectories is bounded, it is possible to generate trajectories robust against such asynchrony with an appropriate modification of the optimization problem. Finally, we demonstrate these ideas on selected examples."

Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/removal of a sensor to/from the network or displacement/misplacement/mis-orientation of the physical sensors on the body. We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our realtime dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor. This performance is only 11.2% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor."

In order to function properly, these embedded software systems rely on and are highly interdependent with other hardware and software systems. This research identifies design principles for large-scale mission-critical embedded software and investigates their application in development strategies, architectures, and techniques. We have examined actual embedded software systems from two different problem domains, advanced robotic spacecraft and financial market systems, and these analyses established the foundations for these design principles. Both system types embody solutions that respond to detailed specifications defined and modeled with heavy user involvement. Both system types possess mission-critical logic represented using state machines and other structured techniques. They both use a layered architecture approach with a foundation that provides infrastructure services, a layer with a simple set of foreground and background tasks, a layer with deterministic synchronous processing steps, and a layer with event-driven monitoring, commanding, and sequencing capabilities. The architectural approach supports a domain-specific command sequencing macro language that defines table-driven executable specifications and enables developers to work at higher abstraction levels throughout the lifecycle. The architectural approach also facilitates extensibility, reuse, and portability across multi-processor execution environments. The systems rely on extensive built-in self-tests, invariants, and redundant calculations that assess states and detect faults. From a development standpoint, both systems use risk-driven incremental lifecycles, system modeling, end-to-end prototyping, and statistical analysis of development processes. Based on insights gained from embedded software design principles and their application on these as well as other systems, improvement opportunities and research directions will be identified. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009."

The amount of embedded electronics and software to realize these systems increases continuously, and hence the complexity of the integration. The functional validation and testing of these systems is of increasing importance, as these systems have an inreasing impact on other systems like comfort and safety functionalities. So there is a need for thourough testing. However, exhaustive testing is not possible as testing in industry is limited by time and resources. So a method is needed to derive systematically the most significant test cases in order to be able to assess the behavior of the system. We applied test models to accomplish this task. A Timed Usage Model served as a formal requirement specification and was the basis for following test activities. The model provides the possibility to describe timing and data dependencies of the system to be tested. The test planning and test case generation was supported by the models. The appliance of models allowed the systematic generation of test cases and the assessment of the significance of the conducted test activities with respect to the coverage of requirements. ©2010 IEEE."
Systematic Model-Based Design and Implementation of Supervisors for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems,"Korssen, Tim;Dolk, Victor;Van De Mortel-Fronczak, Joanna;Reniers, Michel;Heemels, Maurice",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018,IEEE,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2018-02-01,10.1109/TITS.2017.2776354,2-s2.0-85039782617,advanced driver assistance systems | automotive engineering | control system synthesis | model-driven development | Supervisory control,"© 2000-2011 IEEE.The number of advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and the level of automation in modern vehicles is increasing at a rapid pace. Moreover, multiple of these ADASs can be active at the same time and therefore may need to interact with each other. As a consequence, the design of the supervisor layer that is responsible for proper coordination of the control tasks performed by the low-level ADASs controllers is becoming more complex and safety-critical. For this reason, there is a strong need for automated synthesis tools that lead to supervisors that are safe by design. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to model-based supervisor design using discrete-event system representations. In particular, this paper shows that the proposed method is suitable to deal with the multiple and complex systems of interacting ADASs. To be more specific, in contrast to current practice, which often relies on textual specifications and exhaustive testing, the proposed method has four main advantages: 1) it is based on mathematically specified requirements that only allow one interpretation; 2) it prevents blocking situations by design; 3) it guarantees correctness in the sense that the resulting supervisor satisfies all the specified requirements; and 4) code is generated from the obtained supervisor which eliminates the need for manual coding. The proposed method is demonstrated by means of a case study on cruise control and adaptive cruise control. The resulting supervisor is validated by simulations and experiments on a modern passenger vehicle. Based on the results presented in this paper, it can be concluded that the model-based supervisor design, simulation, and implementation method is promising and powerful for future applications in the automated vehicle systems."

It starts at the very first steps when the operational scenarios are defined with the stakeholders and ends with a successful simulation execution. Although the importance of simulation scenarios has long been well-known, there still exists a lack of common understanding and standardized practices which lead to degraded interoperability and shareability. There is a recent effort coordinated by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee (MSTC) towards development of a standard scenario definition language for aviation. This effort is being challenged by the same system complexity. Ontologies provide means to tackle complexity in domain modelling. This paper presents two distinct ontology based approaches to develop simulation scenario definition language for aviation.

The effects of an emotion in one session of communication can persist across sessions. In this work, we attempt automatic emotion detection by jointly modeling the typing characteristics, and the persistence of emotion. Typing characteristics, like speed, number of mistakes, special characters used, are inferred from typing sessions. Self reports recording emotion states after typing sessions capture persistence of emotion. We use this data to train a personalized machine learning model for multi-state emotion classification. We implemented an Android based smartphone application, called TapSense, that records typing related metadata, and uses a carefully designed Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to collect emotion self reports. We are able to classify four emotion states - happy, sad, stressed, and relaxed, with an average accuracy (AUCROC) of 84% for a group of 22 participants who installed and used TapSense for 3 weeks."

The correlation filter uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the convolution in time domain to the multiplication operation in frequency domain, thereby effectively training the filter model. The initial tracking frequency based on the Discriminant Correlation Filter (DCF) can reach 700 frames per second. DCF has progressed rapidly in recent years. Trackers such as Spatially Regularized DCF (SRDCF) and Continuous Convolution Operator Tracker(C-COT) have a high degree of accuracy when tracking targets. However, while pursuing better tracking performance, the high-speed and real-time characteristics of the relevant filters are also gradually declined. The increase in the complexity of the model and the variety of target features increases the risk of over-fitting of these trackers. To solve these problems, this paper proposes three solutions: 1. Use deconvolution algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of input image features, thereby reducing the amount of model update operations, improve the speed of our tracker; 2. Prediction of the target position, which reduces the number of candidate boxes, speeds up the positioning process, and improves the tracking performance of moving targets. 3. Reduces the frequency of model updates, saves tracking time, and avoids model drift. Compared with STRCF, our tracker with deep features provides a 5×speedup with only 3.1% decrease in success plots rate (SR) on OTB-2015."

The main challenges to satisfying these requirements in mobile robot research include the collection of robot environment information, storage and organization of this information, and fast task planning based on available information. Conventional approaches to these problems are far from satisfactory due to their requirement of high computation time. In this paper, we specifically address the problems of storage and organization of the environment information and fast task planning in the area of robotic research. We propose an special object-oriented data model (OODM) for information storage and management in order to solve the first problem. This model explicitly represents domain knowledge and abstracts a global perspective about the robot's dynamically changing environment. To solve the second problem, we introduce a fast task planning algorithm that fully uses domain knowledge related to robot applications and to the given environment. Our OODM based task planning method presents a general frame work and representation, into which domain specific information, domain decomposition methods and specific path planners can be tailored for different task planning problems. This method unifies and integrates the salient features from various areas such as database, artificial intelligence, and robot path planning, thus increasing the planning speed significantly. © 1997 IEEE."

Based on our studies on the taxi industry in Singapore, we see that the emergence of Uber and Grab in the ride-hailing market has greatly impacted the taxi industry: the average daily taxi ridership for the past two years has been falling continuously, by close to 207. in total. In this work, we discuss how efficient real-time data analytics and large-scale multi-agent optimization technology could potentially help taxi drivers compete against more technologically advanced service platforms. Our technology is based on an earlier theoretical work proven to work in a series of simulation studies. Our major contribution in this paper is the demonstration that the proposed design, when coupled with a real-time data feed of close to 20,000 taxis around Singapore, can indeed help drivers to improve their performances. To provide concrete real-world evidence that such technology can indeed benefit taxi drivers, we have tested the driver guidance syst em (DGS) operationally since September 2017. With 361 recruited drivers and 5 months of operational data, we have demonstrated that when drivers actively follow our guidance during their roami ng (more than 60% of roaming time before acquiring a trip), their expected roaming times can be reduced by 22% when compared to the cases where guidances are not followed. By further breaking down the analysis by time periods, workdays, and areas, we point out the spatial-temporal combinations in which the DGS is most useful."

The robot has two sections for articulation actuated by tendon wires. By actuating the two sections independently, the robot can generate a variety of tip positions while maintaining the tip direction. This feature offers more flexibility in positioning the tip for large viewing angles of up to 18 than does a conventional endoscope. To accurately estimate the tip position at large viewing angles, we employed kinematic mapping with a tension propagation model including friction between the tendon wires and the robot body. In a simulation study using this kinematic mapping, the two-section robot at a target scale (outer diameter 1.7 mm and length 60 mm) produced a variety of tip positions within 50-mm ranges at the 180 angle view. In the experimental validation, a 10:1 scale prototype performed three salient postures with different tip positions at the 180 angle view. The proposed forward kinematic mapping (FKM) predicted the tip position within a tip-to-tip error of 6 mm over the 208-mm articulating length. The tip-to-tip error by FKM was significantly less than the one by conventional piecewise-constant-curvature approximation (FKM: 5.9 ± 2.9 mm versus PCCA: 23.7 ± 3.6 mm, n = 15, P < 0.01)."

Testicular toxicity of dibromoacetonitrile and possible protection by tertiary butylhydroquinone,"Abdel-Wahab, Mohamed H.",Pharmacological Research,2003,ScienceDirect,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,1,NN,NO,Exclude,,ar,Pharmacological Research,2003-06-01,10.1016/S1043-6618(03)00039-2,2-s2.0-0038415032,Dibromoacetonitrile | Mice | Oxidative stress | Tertiary butylhydroquinone | Testes,"Dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) is known to be water disinfectant by-product. Its broad-spectrum toxicity in different test systems in vivo and in vitro has been reported. Oxidative damage induced by DBAN may be partially responsible for its toxicity. Herein, the ability of DBAN to induce oxidative stress in mouse testis and possible protective effect of an antioxidant tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) were addressed. Male albino mice were injected with a single dose of DBAN (50mg/kg i.p.), and killed after 3h of treatment. Control animals received 10ml/kg body weight i.p. of the vehicle DMSO. In both experiments, cauda epididymis were dissected and sperm count and motility were investigated. Also, testicular activity of lactic dehydrogenase-x (LDH-x) isozyme and histopathological changes were examined. Furthermore, testicular content of malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were determined. A single i.p. dose of DBAN caused decrease in sperm count and motility to approximately 88 and 84%, respectively, compared with control animals. A 46% decrease in testicular activity of LDH-x, compared with control animals, was observed. A significant accumulation of MDA in DBAN-treated animals was increased to 99% while testicular content of GSH was decreased by 56% compared to control animals. Compared to DBAN-treated animals, treatment with TBHQ (100mg/kg p.o.) prior exposure to DBAN showed a remarkable degree of protection as indicated by enhancement of sperm count and motility, testicular activity of LDH-x, and GSH. Accumulation of testicular content of MDA significantly decreased following TBHQ treatment compared to DBAN-treated animals. In conclusion, results presented here indicate that DBAN is capable to induce oxidative stress in mouse testis. TBHQ may play a protective role against DBAN-induced testicular cellular damage. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Features tend to interact and impact one another's behavior in unknown ways. A challenge is to detect and manage feature interactions, in particular, those that violate system requirements, hence leading to failures. In this paper, we propose a technique to detect feature interaction failures by casting this problem into a search-based test generation problem. We define a set of hybrid test objectives (distance functions) that combine traditional coverage-based heuristics with new heuristics specifically aimed at revealing feature interaction failures. We develop a new search-based test generation algorithm, called FITEST, that is guided by our hybrid test objectives. FITEST extends recently proposed many-objective evolutionary algorithms to reduce the time required to compute fitness values. We evaluate our approach using two versions of an industrial self-driving system. Our results show that our hybrid test objectives are able to identify more than twice as many feature interaction failures as two baseline test objectives used in the software testing literature (i.e., coverage-based and failure-based test objectives). Further, the feedback from domain experts indicates that the detected feature interaction failures represent real faults in their systems that were not previously identified based on analysis of the system features and their requirements."

Testing such systems is complicated by complex and multidimensional input spaces. We propose an automated testing algorithm that builds on learnable evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms rely on machine learning or a combination of machine learning and Darwinian genetic operators to guide the generation of new solutions (test scenarios in our context). Our approach combines multiobjective population-based search algorithms and decision tree classification models to achieve the following goals: First, classification models guide the search-based generation of tests faster towards critical test scenarios (i.e., test scenarios leading to failures). Second, search algorithms refine classification models so that the models can accurately characterize critical regions (i.e., the regions of a test input space that are likely to contain most critical test scenarios). Our evaluation performed on an industrial automotive automotive system shows that: (1) Our algorithm outperforms a baseline evolutionary search algorithm and generates 78% more distinct, critical test scenarios compared to the baseline algorithm. (2) Our algorithm accurately characterizes critical regions of the system under test, thus identifying the conditions that are likely to lead to system failures."

The use of Design by Contract assists in creating such model specifications. However, writing from scratch a large amount of assertions can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Consequently, a number of constraint patterns have been identified in the literature, and corresponding OCL specifications have been proposed. Automating their use in tools should speed the writing task and increase its correctness. Yet, no attention has been paid to the influence of such specifications on the testing process. We approach this area by proposing new OCL specification patterns for some of the existing constraint patterns. Our proposal should increase the efficiency while testing/debugging models and applications. Relevant examples and tool-support are used in order to explain and validate our approach."

A multi agent system (MAS) is composed of AC instances, each AC instance consists of a knowledge base, storing the beliefs of an AC instance, of slots, storing the communication partners of an AC instance, of a set of ontologies, that represent domain specific languages for certain contexts, and of so-called ProcessComponents (PC) representing the behaviours of an AC instance. The AC is a generic component that can be reused (instantiated ACs) and parametrized by customizing the communication partners (slots), the ontologies and the behaviours (PCs) that can be added and removed from any AC instance. Hereby we achieve added value for agents and components. Agents can be easily composed, customized and reused whereas components get enhanced communication and interaction facilities from agents. We present this approach in detail, show how to construct a component-based MAS by a simple example and present a graphical tool for composing systems of AgentComponents."

The features are extracted from infrared images of electrical equipments and classified by using random forest algorithm. In the experiments, the classification performances of various input features are evaluated. The commonly used indicators to describe the classification performance, including sensitivity(TPR), specificity(TNR), accuracy(ACC) and area under curve (AUC) are employed to identify the most suitable input feature as well as the best configuration of classifiers. The results of the experimental demonstrate that the combination of features including Skewness, Max, Kurtosis, 0.95 percentile, Gradient Direction Histogram, Max-Min, 0.75 percentile and other features can result in the best effect for infrared images fault diagnosis. In addition, the Random Forest performs better than the support vector machine(SVM) using radial basis kernel function (RBF) or gaussian kernel function. At the end of the paper, we further discuss how those features effect the fault diagnosis with infrared images. And as for employing the results in fault detection robots, it shows a considerably good effect in terms of accuracy and convenience compared with some traditional methods. It endows those robots with the abilities to make a real time monitoring and detect the faults."

To enable the exchange an abstraction layer - the AUTOSAR runtime environment (RTE) - has been defined as a set of services provided to applications. Typical services are communication via buses, memory access, or diagnostic support. The services are implemented by several stacks of basic SW-modules being highly configurable to support the large variety of ECUs. By configuration, the same SW module can be used for those ECUs with a given micro-controller abstraction. To exploit the variability in a structured approach, AUTOSAR defined a methodology which heavily makes use of so-called templates capturing all information of an electronic vehicle network. The data-structures are defined by a meta-model allowing for a consistent definition of the templates. The development approach adopted by AUTOSAR is related to model-driven development. At the first step in the methodology, an overall system description is defined showing the logical architecture of the SW system. Each SW component is described by an instance of the SW-template. When the SW system shall be applied to an electronic network, the dedicated HW resources must be described as well. So, the properties and capabilities of ECUs and buses are captured by an ECU resource template. During the next step, a mapping of the logical to the physical architecture has to be found. This task is of high importance, since it determines the overall system performance. Once the mapping is established, configuration files for individual ECUs of the network are generated. Based on the configuration the appropriate SW-components can be loaded onto the ECU and the required communication channels are established such that the SW application can be successfully executed. Currently, there is no strong tool-support for mapping besides plain editors. Rule-based transformations may be applied to define and realize (semi-) automatic mapping strategies for the different areas in the system and ECU resource template. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We prototypically implemented a repository-driven online computer system (CardioOP) for teleteaching in Heart Surgery. It supports authoring and multiple re-use of multimedia data for different user groups in different instructional applications and therefore requires a process of content management. Methods. We defined objectives for a terminological system to support semantic, cross-media type annotation and retrieval of learning objects: domain completeness, German (natural) language processing, multi-user concepts, extensibility and maintenance, content based annotation and technical implementation. Existing terminologies (ICD10, READ V3, Snomed III, UMLS 1997, MESH) have been analysed according to these objectives. Results: We found that the analysed terminologies did not meet our criteria sufficiently. Therefore, we developed a domain-specific thesaurus, the CardioOP-DataClas (CDC). The application of the CDC within a database-driven authoring process using specifically developed tools is reported. Conclusions: Metadata play an important role in the effective discovery and search, access, integration and management of educational multimedia data in medicine but so far, there is no terminology to support content management for instructional multimedia. We protolypically designed and applied a thesaurus for the CardioOP educational system. Additional work is needed to evaluate the system in terms of user-friendliness, concept coverage and information retrieval performance."

The limited resources of unmanned spacecraft, coupled with the requirements for completely automated operations, was another factor contributing to the high costs of scientific research in space. In previous space missions after developing, integrating and transporting costly experiments into space and obtaining successful data, the experiment facility and spacecraft have been lost forever, because they could not be returned to earth. The objective of this paper is to present how the utilization of the Spacelab System will result in cost benefits to the scientific community, and significantly reduce the cost of space operations from previous space programs. The following approach was used to quantify the cost benefits of using the Spacelab System to greatly reduce the operational costs of scientific research in space. An analysis was made of the series of activities required to combine individual scientific experiments into an integrated payload that is compatible with the Space Transportation System (STS). These activities, including Shuttle and Spacelab integration, communications and data processing, launch support requirements, and flight operations were analyzed to indicate how this new space system, when compared with previous space systems, will reduce the cost of space research. It will be shown that utilization of the Spacelab modular design, standard payload interfaces, optional Mission Dependent Equipment (MDE), and standard services, such as the Experiment Computer Operating System (ECOS), allow the user many more services than previous programs, at significantly lower costs. In addition, the missions will also be analyzed to relate their cost benefit contributions to space scientific research. The analytical tools that are being developed at MSFC in the form of computer programs that can rapidly analyze experiment to Spacelab interfaces will be discussed to show how these tools allow the Spacelab integrator to economically establish the payload compatibility of a Spacelab mission. The information used in this paper has been assimilated from the actual experience gained in integrating over 50 highly complex, scientific experiments that will fly on the Spacelab first and second missions. In addition, this paper described the work being done at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to define the analytical integration tools and techniques required to economically and efficiently integrate a wide variety of Spacelab payloads and missions. The conclusions reached in this study are based on the actual experience gained at MSFC in its roles of Spacelab integration and mission managers for the first three Spacelab missions. The results of this paper will clearly show that the cost benefits of the Spacelab system will greatly reduce the costs and increase the opportunities for scientific investigation from space. © 1981."

The two directions for interpreting Object Grammars are parsing and formatting. Parsing transforms text into an object graph by recognizing syntactic features and creating the corresponding object structure. In the reverse direction, formatting recognizes object graph features and generates an appropriate textual presentation. The key to Object Grammars is the expressive power of the mapping, which decouples the syntactic structure from the graph structure. To handle graphs, Object Grammars support declarative annotations for resolving textual names that refer to arbitrary objects in the graph structure. Predicates on the semantic structure provide additional control over the mapping. Furthermore, Object Grammars are compositional so that languages may be defined in a modular fashion. We have implemented our approach to Object Grammars as one of the foundations of the Enso¯ system and illustrate the utility of our approach by showing how it enables definition and composition of domain-specific languages (DSLs)."

In recent years, agent-based workflow management systems (WfMS) have been widely used to monitor and control business design processes. In this paper, intelligent agents are applied to the collaborative system-on-chip (SoC) design environment. The proposed JADE-based autonomous workflow management system (JAWMS) uses a workflow coordination mechanism and an agent integration mechanism to enable the analysis, management and interaction of automated design processes. The workflow coordination mechanism uses five domain specific agents to perform the workflow enactment services and a generic agent to control the system flow logic. The system kernel of JAWMS follows the specifications of the workflow reference model provided by the workflow management coalition (WfMC). The agent integration mechanism supports an agent to interact with other JADE-based agent platforms and to coordinate and monitor workflow coordination messages. All agents are written in the Java language using the JADE platform and work together to perform flexible, adaptive and dynamic design tasks in an autonomous and collaborative way. JAWMS facilitates SoC design and team interaction in a collaborative but distributed product development environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The platform itself on which software runs may change over time, as we move towards cloud computing. These changes are difficult to predict and anticipate, and their occurrence is out of control of the application developers. Because of these changes, the applications themselves need to change. Often, changes in the applications cannot be handled off-line, but require the software to self-react by adapting its behavior dynamically, to continue to ensure the desired quality of service. The big challenge in front of us is how to achieve the necessary degrees of flexibility and dynamism required by software without compromising the necessary dependability. This paper advocates that future software engineering research should focus on providing intelligent support to software at run-time, breaking today's rigid boundary between development-time and run-time. Models need to continue to live at run-time and evolve as changes occur while the software is running. To ensure dependability, analysis that the updated system models continue to satisfy the goals must be performed by continuous verification. If verification fails, suitable adjustment policies, supported by model-driven rederivation of parts of the system, must be activated to keep the system aligned with its expected requirements. The paper presents the background that motivates this research focus, the main existing research directions, and an agenda for future work. Copyright 2010 ACM."

The findings are organized into five temporal categories characterizing the evolution of psychotherapy research. All five categories are integrated in the central phenomenon of two views of human behavior, a reactive or a proactive view. The categories are (1) psychotherapy is no more effective than no psychotherapy (1950s and 1960s), (2) the ""core conditions"" (empathic understanding, unconditional positive regard, and congruency) are necessary and sufficient conditions for therapeutic personality change (1960s and 1970s), (3) psychotherapy is for better or for worse (early 1960s), (4) the core conditions are necessary but not sufficient for therapeutic personality change (late 1970s and mid-1980s), and (5) specific techniques are uniquely effective in treating particular disorders (late 1980s and early 1990s). The findings concerned with Categories 4 and 5 are (a) that the conclusion that Rogers's attitudinal conditions are necessary but not sufficient has virtually no direct research support, and (b) that the research concerning specificity of treatment, dysfunction, therapist variables, and client variables is characterized by fragmentation, few replications, and lack of generalizability. Implications of the study indicate that specificity research, driven by the unfounded assertion that Rogers' attitudinal conditions are not sufficient, have yielded inconclusive and misleading findings. The pattern of research is one that culminates in the picture of a self-fulfilling model driven and directed by the ""scientificating"" deterministic view of human behavior, the movement toward narrow and specific application. Over four decades, the major thread in psychotherapy efficacy research is the presence of the therapist attitudes hypothesized by Rogers. © 1994 American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology (AAAPP) All rights reserved."

With autonomous driving, we can expect touch interaction with such in-vehicle media systems to exponentially increase. In spite of vehicle suspension systems, road perturbations will continue to exert forces that can render in-vehicle touch interaction challenging. Using a motion simulator, we investigate how different vehicle speeds interact with road features (i.e., speed bumps) to influence touch interaction. We determine their effect on pointing accuracy and task completion time. We show that road bumps have a significant effect on touch input and can decrease accuracy by 19%. In light of this, we developed a Random Forest (RF) model that improves touch accuracy by 32.0% on our test set and by 22.5% on our validation set. As the lightweight model uses only features that can easily be determined through inertial measurement units, this model could be easily deployed in current automobiles."

Rats were divided into 4 groups according to age (young vs. aged) and treatment (GBE vs. vehicle). GBE or vehicle was given for 30. d, and a series of behavioral tests were performed. Following behavioral testing, blood samples and brain tissues were obtained for analysis of BDNF, malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and glutathione levels, and superoxide dismutase activity. Locomotor activity and anxiety levels were lower in the aged rats. Based on Morris water maze probe trial findings, GBE supplementation increased the number of platform crossings in the aged rats. MDA and 8-OHdG levels were lower in the brain tissue, and BDNF levels were higher in plasma in the rates treated with GBE. Based on these findings, we concluded that GBE supplementation improved cognitive functions by decreasing oxidative damage and increasing the BDNF level in aged female rats."

This problem can be faced by applying the Situational Method Engineering (SME) approach, which enables to build appropriate methodologies by composing ""fragments"" of existing ones. We envision this approach as the future of software engineering in general, and in particular if applied in Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). This approach has also the valuable advantage of reusing models, solutions, experiences and tools of existing and tested methodologies. In this paper we report three examples of application of the Situational Method Engineering approach in AOSE. We show that this approach can be applied following different directions, and in particular: entity-driven, metamodel-driven, and characteristic-driven. To concretely show these directions, we present three examples of methodologies for developing agent systems (one regarding self-organising systems), all constructed composing methodology fragments to meet the scenario requirements."

Capable of operation at depths of up to 6000 meters and altitudes above the seafloor of approximately 500 meters, it maps a swath up to 5 kilometers in width. This new system performs all signal processing in the digital domain, using Motorola 56309 digital signal processors to acquire signals from the vehicle's transducer arrays. All transducer channels can be driven with arbitrary waveforms during transmit, allowing both conventional CW transmissions and coded pulses with FM, AM, and/or phase modulation. Center frequencies for quadrature detection are programmable, as is decimation filtering to match the transmitted waveforms. The programmable nature of the system electronics design allows use at a range of frequencies up to 140 kHz, and is also used as part of the DSL-120A sonar operated by the Deep Submergence Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Processed acoustic data, along with environmental parameters and electronics monitors are telemetered to the surface via optical fiber. At the surface, the sonar telemetry link is converted to a standard AES/EBU digital audio stream for compatibility with commercial off-the-shelf components making up a Linux workstation."

Concerning appearance, some vehicles are designed to look more assertive than others, and it is believed that vehicle appearance may reflect the driver's social behavior in traffic. In the case of autonomous vehicles, since the human driver no longer controls the vehicle's action, the question arises whether pedestrians treat autonomous and manually-driven vehicles differently when deciding to cross the street. We devised an experiment to determine the impact of the behavioral and physical attributes of a vehicle on pedestrians' roadcrossing decisions, both for manually-driven and autonomous vehicles. Preliminary results show that in both cases, distance and speed play a dominant role in pedestrians' decision to cross a road when compared to the vehicle's size and appearance."

We propose that balancing the driver's need of being informed about the automated vehicle's status, actions and intentions with the desire to engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) is likely to play an important role in this process."

The first challenge is to create the hand's articulated structure and the second challenge is to actuate it to move like a human hand. A robotic hand for humanoid robot should look and behave human like. At the same time, it also needs to be light and cheap for widely used purposes. We start with studying the biomechanical features of a human hand and propose a simplified mechanical model of robotic hands, which can achieve the important local motions of the hand. Then, we use 3D modeling techniques to create a single interlocked hand model that integrates pin and ball joints to our hand model. Compared to other robotic hands, our design saves the time required for assembling and adjusting, which makes our robotic hand ready-to-use right after the 3D printing is completed. Finally, the actuation of the hand is realized by cables and motors. Based on this approach, we have designed a cost-effective, 3D printable, compact, and lightweight robotic hand. Our robotic hand weighs 150 g, has 15 joints, which are similar to a real human hand, and 6 Degree of Freedom (DOFs). It is actuated by only six small size actuators. The wrist connecting part is also integrated into the hand model and could be customized for different robots such as Nadine robot (Magnenat Thalmann et al., 2017). The compact servo bed can be hidden inside the Nadine robot's sleeve and the whole robotic hand platform will not cause extra load to her arm as the total weight (150 g robotic hand and 162 g artificial skin) is almost the same as her previous unarticulated robotic hand which is 348 g. The paper also shows our test results with and without silicon artificial hand skin, and on Nadine robot."

The 129I is separated from other nuclides in LILWs using an anion exchange adsorption and solvent extraction by controlling the oxidation and reduction state and is then precipitated as silver iodide for counting the beta activity with a low background gas proportional counter (GPC). The counting efficiency of GPC was varied from 4% to 8% and it was reversely proportional to the weight of AgI by a self absorption of the beta activity. Compared to a higher pH, the chemical recovery of iodide as AgI was lowered at pH 4. It was found that the chemical recovery of iodide for the cement powder showed a lower trend by increasing the cement powder weight, but it was not affected for the paraffin sample. In this experiment, the overall chemical recovery yield of the cement and paraffin solidified LILW samples and the average weight of them were 67±3% and 5.43±0.53 g, 70±7% and 10.40±1.60 g, respectively. And the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of 129I for the cement and paraffin solidified LILW samples was calculated as 0.070 and 0.036 Bq/g, respectively. Among the analyzed cement solidified LILW samples, 129I activity concentration of four samples was slightly higher than the MDA and their ranges were 0.076-0.114 Bq/g. Also of the analyzed paraffin solidified LILW samples, five samples contained a little higher 129I activity concentration than the MDA and their ranges were 0.036-0.107 Bq/g. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.Objective The gold standard for diagnosing sleep disorders is polysomnography, which generates extensive data about biophysical changes occurring during sleep. We developed the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), a comprehensive system for sharing sleep data. The NSRR embodies elements of a data commons aimed at accelerating research to address critical questions about the impact of sleep disorders on important health outcomes. Approach We used a metadata-guided approach, with a set of common sleep-specific terms enforcing uniform semantic interpretation of data elements across three main components: (1) annotated datasets; (2) user interfaces for accessing data; and (3) computational tools for the analysis of polysomnography recordings. We incorporated the process for managing dataset-specific data use agreements, evidence of Institutional Review Board review, and the corresponding access control in the NSRR web portal. The metadata-guided approach facilitates structural and semantic interoperability, ultimately leading to enhanced data reusability and scientific rigor. Results The authors curated and deposited retrospective data from 10 large, NIH-funded sleep cohort studies, including several from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, into the NSRR. The NSRR currently contains data on 26 808 subjects and 31 166 signal files in European Data Format. Launched in April 2014, over 3000 registered users have downloaded over 130 terabytes of data. Conclusions The NSRR offers a use case and an example for creating a full-fledged data commons. It provides a single point of access to analysis-ready physiological signals from polysomnography obtained from multiple sources, and a wide variety of clinical data to facilitate sleep research."

To enable the application of our framework to foster more theoretical-driven research, we developed a new self-report measurement that assesses bodilyrelated perceptions of the embodiment and corporeality - which we reveal as not being a binary characteristic of artificial entities. For the development and validation of the new scale we conducted two surveys and one video-based experiment. Exploratory factor analysis reveal a four-factorial solution with good reliability (Study 2, n = 442), which was confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis (Study 3, n = 260). In addition, we present first insights into the explanatory power of the scale: We reveal that humans? perceptions of an artificial entity's capabilities vary between virtual and physical embodiments, and that the evaluation of the artificial counterpart can be explained through the perceived capabilities. Practical applications and future research lines are discussed."

Yet it also offers many productivity, maintainability and performance benefits for platform-specific functions, such as the generation of machine code. We have created reliable assemblers for SPARC™, AMD64, IA32 and PowerPC which support all user mode and privileged instructions and with 64-bit mode support for all but the latter. These assemblers are generated as Java source code by our extensible assembler framework, which itself is written in the Java language. The assembler generator also produces javadoc comments that precisely specify the legal values for each operand. Our design is based on the Klein Assembler System written in Self. Assemblers are generated from a specification, as are table-driven disassemblers and unit tests. The specifications that drive the generators are expressed as Java language objects. Thus no extra parsers are needed and developers do not need to learn any new syntax to extend the framework for additional ISAs. Every generated assembler is tested against a preexisting assembler by comparing the output of both. Each instruction's test cases are derived from the cross product of its potential operand values. The majority of tests are positive (i.e., result in a legal instruction encoding). The framework also generates negative tests, which are expected to cause an error detection by an assembler. As with the Klein Assembler System, we have found bugs in the external assemblers as well as in ISA reference manuals. Our framework generates tens of millions of tests. For symbolic operands, our tests include all applicable predefined constants. For integral operands, the important boundary values, such as the respective minimum, maximum, 0, 1 and -1, are tested. Full testing can take hours to run but gives us a high degree of confidence regarding correctness. Copyright 2006 ACM."

This leverages complicated business networks space to include scalable network layers, more devices, and platforms relying on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Despite the fact that traditional IoT platforms usually target the technical side for IoT applications, they are not prepared enough to be easily integrated with pluggable and executable business logic or smart contracts. This makes it difficult to control a collection of shared business network resources in a standard and decentralized manner. With the rise of FinTech due to blockchain technology, it becomes possible to seamlessly engage business networks with financial digital assets. Consequently, combining IoT platforms with blockchain will drive new ways for better services consuming, transparency and products that depend on crowd-based economy[12]. In this paper, Sitechain is proposed as a new architecture to integrate IoT platforms with blockchain technology. The proposed architecture is not locked to specific IoT platforms but it can be extended to support different platforms in a standard, systematic and easy way. Sitechain is demonstrated by integrating Sitewhere and FIWAREIoT platforms with Hyperledger Fabric as a private blockchain network manager. Moreover a modeling language supported by Hyperledger composer is used to easily develop smart contracts and generate RESTful APIs, therefore any smart contract transaction events can bemapped into actions on remote devices.The system testing is performed using a large set of connected shared devices that are deployed as part of private business networks. The results are recorded in the conclusion section."

This results in a complex development process since the models and the relations between the models have to be managed. Similar problems appear when following a model-driven approach for managing software systems at runtime. A multitude of interrelated runtime models are employed simultaneously, and thus they have to be maintained at runtime. While for the development case megamodels have emerged to address the problem of managing models and relations, the problem is rather neglected for the case of runtime models by applying ad-hoc solutions. Therefore, we propose to utilize megamodel concepts for the case of multiple runtime models. Based on the current state of research, we present a categorization of runtime models and conceivable relations between them. The categorization describes the role of interrelated models at runtime and demonstrates that several approaches already employ multiple runtime models and relations. Then, we show how megamodel concepts help in organizing and utilizing runtime models and relations in a model-driven manner while supporting a high level of automation. Finally, the role of interrelated models and megamodels at runtime is discussed for self-adaptive software systems and exemplified by a case study. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

This study investigates the influence of a sense of presence and irritation on users' satisfaction with mobile SNSs. Additionally, the study examines a moderating effect of mobile SNS use intensity between sense of presence (social and self-presence) and irritation (social and technological irritation) and their outcomes.

The goal of this review is to familiarize the reader about the potential involvement of the brain reward system (BRS) in symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The authors introduce a novel approach to study the pathophysiology of MDD that includes pharmacological probing of BRS pathways (e.g. d-amphetamine, hydromorphone) together with an elicited and measurable behavioral component (e.g. pleasant effects, increased energy, altered cognition). 2. To this date, the major focus of MDD pathophysiology studies has been to characterize biological differences between healthy subjects and depressed patients such as alteration in the monoaminergic and endocrine systems. The relative importance of the various biological changes has not been elucidated, that is, linking these with specific behavioral manifestations in MDD have rarely been attempted. 3. One core symptom of MDD is a decreased experience of pleasure or interest in previously enjoyed activities (i.e. anhedonia) such as work or hobbies, and is accompanied by decreased motivation or drive. The BRS consists of the neural pathways involved in eliciting rewarding experiences in animals and humans. 4. The hypothesis is that altered BRS function may be an underlying brain mechanism of the loss of pleasure/interest experienced in MDD, and will be manifested through an altered response to a BRS probe. The authors have examined BRS function in MDD by introducing a pharmacological probe (i.e. d-amphetamine/d-amph). Amphetamine is defined as a probe due to its ability to release dopamine within major components of the BRS (i.e. the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.) In addition to the objective pharmacological effects (e.g. altered heart rate), BRS probes like d-amph elicit reliable and measurable behavior, that is, the hedonic effects. 5. A review of the neurobiology of MDD, the BRS, the rationale for implicating the BRS in depressive symptoms, and preliminary data, are presented in this article. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

I highlight cases from specific ICTD projects, or the way they have been portrayed in the public sphere, to establish ways in which the symbolic value of technology has been an important driver of their purchase in public consciousness. Using these to foreground the discourse of technology in India, I examine the brand imaging of Narendra Modi, the current prime minister of India, and propose that he both understood and ably used the aspirational sentiment toward technology to craft an image of technocrat modernizer, obscuring a longer-standing image as a sectarian politician. I propose that Modi's is a beneficiary of an ICTD wave of thinking in India, and at the same time, his own careful curation of an online persona brings finesse to the notion of a technological self in politics. In this, the citizen-state relationship is mediated by the imagination of an enlightened, tech-savvy politician leading people who are themselves legitimated as citizens by their relationship to the technologies they use."

As a domain-specific language, it allows the mission designer define scheduling aspects of mission with natural-like language rather than various machine oriented parameters. Unlike general purpose planning languages such as NDDL (New Domain Definition Language), the USL is not designed self-completed but lies on various external information. The technology of USL processor involves both complier and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The complier technology transit texts into computer-oriented dependency grammar trees under strict conventions, which is traditional in the computer fields. While NLP is still a progressive field with intelligence computing and big data processing introduced in. NLP applies both structured algorithms and statistics based information to understand general purpose texts. But, with inevitable probabilities, NLP may leads to deviations. With complier and NLP approaches combined, The USL uses a series of conventions to try to avoid ambiguities and still keep the agile characteristic of natural language. The USL customized symbol system and part-of-speech system are established more abundant than general NLP. Processing USL usually covers preprocessing, Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency grammar tree parsing and finally executing the grammar tree. For each approach, a process template is clarified to introduce the basic mechanism of USL processor. The dependency grammar tree parsing is the core of USL processor, which directly determine the success chance. Building the grammar tree from a scheduling requirement description involves searching the most probable node dependent relations based on known patterns. Combined with apparent rules and stochastic approaches, the tree parser is able to support USL applications. The USL is designed extendable. By defining new dictionaries, terminal symbols and non-terminal symbols, the USL accepts new basic types of tree nodes. And a training framework is given to enrich the learning bases in case of misunderstanding new patterns of texts. Currently, the symbol system of USL is defined with dozens of basic symbols. A series of node-corresponding functions are developed to interpret each node of the grammar tree. The architecture of USL processor is implemented and initially proves valid with simple natural-like texts parsed correctly. The USL requires minimum training and mission designers are liberated from filling in aggravating data forms. With the USL, the intelligence of scheduling platform is brought to a new level."

Recent studies on decoy routing consider all decoy routing systems to be susceptible to a fundamental attack-regardless of their specific designs-in which the censors re-route traffic around decoy ASes, thereby preventing censored users from using such systems. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for decoy routing that, by design, is significantly stronger to rerouting attacks compared to all previous designs. Unlike previous designs, our new architecture operates decoy routers only on the downstream traffic of the censored users; therefore we call it downstream-only decoy routing. As we demonstrate through Internet-scale BGP simulations, downstream-only decoy routing offers significantly stronger resistance to rerouting attacks, which is intuitively because a (censoring) ISP has much less control on the downstream BGP routes of its traffic. Designing a downstream-only decoy routing system is a challenging engineering problem since decoy routers do not intercept the upstream traffic of censored users. We design the first downstreamonly decoy routing system, called Waterfall, by devising unique covert communication mechanisms.We also use various techniques to make our Waterfall implementation resistant to traffic analysis attacks. We believe that downstream-only decoy routing is a significant step towards making decoy routing systems practical. This is because a downstream-only decoy routing system can be deployed using a significantly smaller number of volunteer ASes, given a target resistance to rerouting attacks. For instance, we show that a Waterfall implementation with only a single decoy AS is as resistant to routing attacks (against China) as a traditional decoy system (e.g., Telex) with 53 decoy ASes."

In this paper, a comprehensive long-term study of a mobile robot providing information services to residents, visitors, and staff of a care home is presented, with a focus on adapting to the when and where the robot should be offering its services to best accommodate the users' needs. Rather than providing a fixed schedule, the presented system takes the opportunity of long-term deployment to explore the space of possibilities of interaction while concurrently exploiting the model learned to provide better services. But in order to provide effective services to users in a care home, not only then when and where are relevant, but also the way how the information is provided and accessed. Hence, also the usability of the deployed system is studied specifically, in order to provide a most comprehensive overall assessment of a robotic info-terminal implementation in a care setting. Our results back our hypotheses, (i) that learning a spatio-temporal model of users' intentions improves efficiency and usefulness of the system, and (ii) that the specific information sought after is indeed dependent on the location the info-terminal is offered."

The illumination device transmits a spatiotemporal pattern as a series of binary Gray-code patterns. Multiple illumination devices can be combined to localize each marker in 3D at high speed (333Hz). Our method has strengths in accuracy, speed, cost, ambient performance, large working space (1m-5m) and robustness to noise compared with conventional techniques. We compare with a state-of-the-art instrumented glove and vision-based systems to demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of our approach. We propose a fast and accurate method for hand gesture modeling using an inverse kinematics approach with the six photosensitive markers.

Recent joint collaborations between banks and mobile-network operators leverage a customer’s past mobile phone transactions in order to create a credit score for the individual. In this work, we address the problem of launching a mobile-phone based credit scoring system in a new market without the marginal distribution of features of borrowers in the new market. This challenge rules out traditional transfer learning approaches such as a direct covariate shift. We apply a market-based re-weighting scheme of Original Market Borrowers that accounts for the differences in the original and new markets. The goal of applying this generalized covariate shift to three populations is to understand the repayment behavior of a fourth: New Market Borrowers who will self-select into a loan product when it becomes available. To test the approach we use real-world data sets from two Sub-Saharan countries in Africa consisting of 200,000 customers’ telephone records. Our results demonstrate that the market-based re-weighting scheme improves the credit scoring model in the new market compared to other more direct methods."

This paper focuses on adequate representing of time, events and management concerns in information systems owning behavior inspired by system agents. Event-based aspect-oriented approach seems to be the most appropriate solution for this situation, although it lacks smooth methodology going from requirements to code and often is hidden in technological level. Time aspect, thoroughly analyzed in embedded and real-time systems, also lacks of proper attention in the area of information systems despite it is closely related to many information system projects.

However, the performance and safety of these VANET-based systems could be seriously impaired by communication delays and packet losses, which may be caused by network congestion or by malicious attacks that target communication timing behavior. In this paper, we quantitatively model and analyze some of the timing and security issues in transportation networks with VANET-based intelligent intersections. In particular, we demonstrate how communication delays may affect the performance and safety of a single intersection and of multiple interconnected intersections, and present our delay-tolerant intersection management protocols.

Our novel design has the strength that it can provide high data-rate wireless Internet access by utilising existing infrastructure, while utilising the community pool of network resources to provide a distributed network management. We build an autonomous high capacity wireless access network using a combination of cognitive wireless access mechanisms and a distributed processing platform to continuously optimise the configuration and utilisation of the network.

Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show that there are indeed significant performance benefits to be attained by allowing the AP to move intelligently. We also rely on theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental studies to show that the AP optimal location search problem can be split into two parts: a macro-search problem to minimize average path loss between AP and clients, and a micro-search problem to tackle real-time multipath fading effects. We then present Hermes, a self-positioning WiFi AP system that relies on a suite of algorithms to compute and then move to an optimal location within the network.

A particular case of self-adaptation is affective-driven self-adaptation. Affective-driven self-adaptation is about having consciousness of user's affects (emotions) and drive self-adaptation reacting to changes in those affects. Most of the previous work around self-adaptive systems deals with performance, resources, and error recovery as variables that trigger a system reaction. Moreover, most effort around affect recognition has been put towards offline analysis of affect, and to date only few applications exist that are able to infer user's affect in real-time and trigger self-adaptation mechanisms. In response to this deficit, this work proposes a software product line approach to jump-start the development of affect-driven self-adaptive systems by offering the definition of a domain-specific architecture, a set of components (organized as a framework), and guidelines to tailor those components.

Particularly in robotics, it is not very well addressed. This paper introduces a multidimensional assignment (MDA)-based data association algorithm for the simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem in mobile robot navigation. The data association problem is cast in a general discrete optimization framework and the MDA formulation for multitarget tracking is extended for SLAM using sensor location uncertainty with the joint likelihood of measurements over multiple frames as the objective function. Methods for feature initialization and management are also integrated into the algorithm. When clutter is high and features are sparse, the compatibility information of features of a single measurement frame is not sufficient to make effective data-association decisions, thus compromising performance of single-frame-based methods. However, in a multiple-measurement-frame approach, the availability of more than one frame of measurement provides for more effective data-association decisions to be made, as consistency of measurements are looked at in several frames of measurement. Simulations are conducted to verify the performance gains over the conventional nearest neighbor (NN) data association algorithm and the joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) algorithm, especially in the presence of varying densities of spurious measurements and dynamic objects. Experimental results with ground truth are presented to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed data-association method in complex and large outdoor environments and its effectiveness over single-frame-based NN and JCBB schemes. © 2006 IEEE."

Developing applications for MWSN is a complicated process because of the wide variety of WSN applications and low-level implementation details. Integrating context-awareness can improve MWSN applications results. In this paper, some research issues and challenges involved in the design of WSNs are presented.

We propose that the significant differences between Human-Human Conversation (HHC) and Human-Robot Conversation (HRC) in terms of used language and other aspects (e.g., humanlikeness, embodiment, etc.) might affect the quality of the responses from a conversational robot. Hence, the use of HRCs as an input could improve the responses of the robots when the conversational machine learning system is trained using a more realistic model of HRI conversations rather than a HHI model. Future applications of conversational robots in education and health care could be enhanced by using an appropriate HRC corpus."

Engineering a CAS not only involves the definition of the individual agents, but also their roles in achieving a collective task and adaptation strategies to counteract to environmental changes. Current solutions for specifying CAS typically tackle the problem at a low level of abstraction (e.g., writing XML files), making this task time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, such a low level of abstraction hinders the understandability of the specification. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) proposes to reduce the complexity of development by adopting models as first class artifacts in the process. In this respect, this work proposes a MDE approach to enhance CAS specification. In particular, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) made-up of three main views: one devoted to adaptive systems design; one addressing ensembles definition; and one tackling the collective adaptation. These three separate aspects are woven seamlessly by the DSL to constitute a complete CAS design. While the different views allow us to exploit separation-of-concerns to reduce complexity and focus on a specific aspect of the system, facing CAS specification at a higher-level of abstraction permits to use concepts closer to the experts of the involved domains. Moreover, the precise definition of modeling concepts through corresponding meta-models enables correctness-by-construction of the system specification."

To perform their tasks and interact with each other, agents constitute systems called Multi-agent systems (MAS). Although agent researchers have a great effort in MAS metamodeling and model-driven MAS development, a significant deficiency exists in current studies when we consider providing a complete Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML) for MASs. We believe that a DSML increases the descriptive power of a MAS metamodel, defines the system semantics and hence supports a more fruitful methodology for the development of MASs especially working on the new challenging environments such as the Semantic Web. In this paper, we introduce a new DSML for MASs with its abstract syntax, the textual concrete syntax and the interpreter mechanism. The practical use of the DSML is illustrated with a case study which considers the modeling of a multi-agent based e-barter system. Copyright 2010 ACM."

Our main goal is to develop a personalized solution that informs users and promotes healthy behavioral changes in them, as many women are not conscious of the health consequences caused by menopause. To this end, we follow just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), a design framework for the rule-based provision of personalized and on-demand interventions through mobile applications, according to user's health status and behavior. However, these health-related concepts are usually vague and difficult to formalize in a well-constrained manner. Therefore, to overcome these issues, our approach seeks to leverage the knowledge of health professional experts and the capacity of fuzzy logic modelling and inference to formally define such vague concepts and rules. Although we discuss this approach in the context of menopause self-care, in which prior user data may be insufficient for alternative techniques, it could also be applied in other self-care applications facing similar challenges."

All rights reserved.Vehicle computers, Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems are all examples of electronic devices in which embedded systems require greater flexibility to process different types of applications and communication protocols. High flexibility requires the use of general purpose processors as a solution for configuring and controlling several peripherals. However, this also increases the need for hardware-dependent software. Since this is a highly critical and error-prone component due to the nature of its coding and the surrounding environment, it is essential to support the development and runtime phases through methodologies that can detect violations and errors when accessing devices by monitoring the communication protocol. This approach proposes a technique for monitoring temporal properties in high-level communication protocols between devices and drivers using a contract-based specification mechanism for describing the interface and protocol. From this specification, a monitoring module is synthesised, which can detect violation during the simulation of virtual platforms or execution of hardware platforms. The proposed specification language is a domain-specific language that supports platform-based design and enables the iteractive refinement of communication protocol and temporal property specifications along with platform stepwise implementation. Some experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach for detecting errors in device drivers and device access violation."

Moreover, the fact that management tasks are performed by humans leads to many configuration errors and low reactivity. This is particularly true in medium or large-scale distributed infrastructures. To address this issue, we explore the design and implementation of an autonomic management system. The main principle is to wrap legacy software pieces in components in order to administrate a software infrastructure as a component architecture. However, we observed that the interfaces of a component model are too low-level and difficult to use. Consequently, we explore the use of a model driven approach where several UML profiles are used to specify the different facets of an autonomic management policy. © 2008 IEEE."

We combine vision, gesture, speech, and input from an onboard tablet, a remote mobile phone, and external microphones. Our approach includes the proactive seeking of input from a different modality, adding robustness to the failures of the separate components.

Although we might be able to use complicated hardware and software on the robots to achieve the desired accuracy, but such systems might not be applicable in real-time RoboCup environment due to their need for high processing time. To reduce the processing time we developed some basic ideas on the robot's front and omni-directional vision systems. These ideas are inspired by a number of features in the human vision system towards enhancing naive vision systems that work intelligently. These ideas included efficient need-based vision, reducing the number of objects to be detected to a few objects of interest in each frame with the minimum needed accuracy, introduction of static and dynamic regions of interest, proposing first, those areas that are most probable to find our objects of interest, the usage of some domain specific knowledge that is used in detecting and tracking a unique safe point on the ball, and also introducing fast and accurate methods for separating the area inside the soccer field and its outside region in order to reduce the search space to only the area inside the soccer field.

Unlike in traditional software development, where the device layer is essentially completely abstracted away by an operating system, CPS components include low-power edge nodes, gateways, and servers that together provide sensing, actuation, communication, model and state inference, and autonomous or user-driven control. Moreover, the CPS design process involves implementation of these functions at different levels of abstraction, from high-level computational models to bare-mental implementations. Unfortunately, even when advanced testing or verification methods are applied only to low level system aspects, those efforts are separated from high-level tests of a CPS, which are often produced by a different team, and do not stress the low-level system. Effective automated test composition would make it possible to automatically produce integration/system tests for CPS, even with extremely heterogeneous aspects, where individual elements have effective tests but the interactions between the sub-systems are untested. Because of the size of the search space involved and the complexity of modeling and designing CPS, we also propose in the long term a move towards system architectures to support testing across both system layers and levels of abstraction."

Increasing use of digital and networked technologies in people's everyday lives present opportunities for connecting, communicating, interacting, and caring for one another in new ways, as evidenced in the recent emergence of technologies that are designed to support the post-trauma journey. At the same time, there are distinct shortcomings among the existing technologies in effectively responding to the diverse and changing needs and desires of individuals, including meaningful engagement of trusted others, such as friends and family outside the therapy environment. After examining 83 existing design interventions that provide trauma-related support, this paper identifies six broad themes evident in their approaches: symbolic engagements, creative offerings of comfort and encouragements of self-care, the creative sharing of stories, online communities and agony aunts, the digitisation and re-design of psychology intervention, biometrics and data-driven. It further interrogates related opportunities and challenges to deliberate on how interventions might be designed with and for care at the intersection of communities and technologies, with a focus on engaging trusted others who in various ways and degrees, have a substantial impact on the post-trauma journey beyond therapy."

Self-adaptation facilitates the performance of automated maintenance and configuration tasks, but makes it possible for faults to be introduced into the software at runtime. To address this issue, researchers have developed approaches for integrating runtime testing into autonomic and adaptive software systems. An important aspect of runtime testing approaches for autonomic software is the provision of a framework for regression testing, which determines whether modifications have introduced faults into previously tested components. However, after adaptation occurs in autonomic software, a predefined test set may no longer be applicable due to changes in the program structure. Investigating techniques for dynamically updating regression tests after adaptation is therefore necessary to ensure such approaches can be applied in practice. In this paper we describe a model-driven approach that maps structural adaptations in autonomic software, to updates for its runtime test model. We provide a workflow and meta-model to support the approach, referred to as Test Information Propagation (TIP). To demonstrate TIP, we have developed a prototype that simulates a reductive change to an autonomic, service-oriented healthcare application. Conducting the simulation has provided us with much insight into this highly challenging research problem. © 2011 IEEE."

A physically active lifestyle consisting of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and non-sedentary hours helps in improving pain and mobility in arthritis patients. Physiotherapists recommend an appropriate amount of physical activity to patients so that the patients can maintain a physically active lifestyle without further hurting the joints. However, meeting the goals set by a physiotherapist becomes hard when the patient experiences a flare in the symptoms. When the symptoms flare, clinicians can help the patients in adjusting their goals. However, a meeting with a physiotherapist is not always possible. E-coaching solutions provide an opportunity to provide immediate feedback to the patients. Receiving immediate feedback is useful for patients in performing an adequate amount of physical activity without hurting the joints. We developed and studied a web application to support the clinician-guided physical activity among arthritis patients. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the study for future automated e-coaching solutions designed to support physical activity among arthritis patients."

The goal of this work is to provide a programmable and dynamic framework that can support these applications. The framework uses software-defined environment concepts to drive the process of dynamically composing infrastructure services from multiple providers. The resulting distributed software-defined environment autonomously evolves over the application life cycle while meeting objectives and constraints set by the users, applications, and/or resource providers. We present two different approaches for programming resources and controlling the composition process, one that is based on a rule engine and another that leverages constraint programming.

In previous work we proposed a model-driven approach that uses automatically synthesized finite-state controllers from scenariobased assume/guarantee specifications to safely and efficiently dynamically update the system. In this paper we describe an execution infrastructure of this approach, which allows us to execute and deploy newly synthesized dynamically updating controllers on embedded devices. We present a prototype implementation in Java for Lego Mindstorms robots. This experience gained can lead to a systematic approach to implement dynamic updates in the aforementioned critical software-intensive systems."

Traditional development approaches are not prepared for that shift.

The modern technology of the equipment allows optimisation of the operations with respect to the operating conditions. When several mobile equipments are used together in a process, the benefits from their individual optimisation may disappear. Therefore, the execution of an open-air engineering process by cooperating mobile equipment needs to be carefully planned for their effective utilisation. However, dynamics in the open and distributed operating environment of these processes make the planning truly complex. Important planning information, such as the duration of operations, cannot be accurately determined in advance. The progress of the process, equipment performance and operating conditions need to be monitored and this information should be considered for the planning. This paper presents an approach to develop an online planning system with a focus on enhancing process visibility to enable better-informed decision making. To realise these objectives, the PROSA reference architecture and the accompanying delegate multi-agent system are considered. The online planning system based on PROSA is model-driven. It uses executable models to model operations, generating short-term operational forecasts. The forecasting mechanism provides a realistic view on the progress of the process, alerts on potential problems and opportunities and enables to evaluate planning alternatives. This online planning system is implemented as a prototype for open-pit mine planning. However, due to the model-driven nature of the system, this approach is equally applicable to other outdoor engineering processes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

To advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants to investigate how different personalities respond to various persuasive strategies that are used in persuasive health games and gamified systems. Our results reveal that people's personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by goal setting, simulation, self-monitoring and feedback; people who are more open to experience are more likely to be demotivated by rewards, competition, comparison, and cooperation.

The head comprises two cameras with coplanar optical axes arranged on a lateral rig, each camera being free to vary its angle of vergence. Under various constraints, we derive novel explicit forms for the epipolar equation, and show that a static stereo head constitutes a degenerate camera configuration for carrying out self-calibration. The situation is retrieved by consideration of a stereo head undergoing ground plane motion, and new closed-form solutions for self-calibration are derived. An error analysis reveals that reconstruction is adversely affected by inward-facing camera vergence angles that are similar in value, and by a principal point location whose horizontal component is in error. It is also shown that the adoption of domain-specific robust techniques for computation of the fundamental matrix can significantly improve the quality of scene reconstruction. Experiments conducted with dynamic stereo head images confirm that avoidance of near-degenerate configurations and use of robustness techniques are essential if reliable reconstructions are to be attained. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we propose that safety-critical concerns regarding the robot software be explicitly declared separately from the main program, in terms of externally observable properties of the software. Concretely, we use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to declaratively specify a set of safety-related rules that the software must obey, as well as corresponding corrective actions that trigger when rules are violated. Our prototype DSL is integrated with ROS, is shown to be capable of specifying safetyrelated constraints, and is experimentally demonstrated to enforce safety behaviour in existing robot software. We believe our approach could be extended to other fields to similarly simplify safety certification."

However, they seem insufficient when dealing with real-world applications.

As a result, the aggregation of new capabilities (and their interactions) makes the evaluation of the overall performance more complex. Second, performance metrics only offer a partial view of the system quality in which non-functional properties, such as user experience, efficiency or reliability, are generally ignored. In this paper, we introduce RoQME, an Integrated Technical Project funded by the EU H2020 RobMoSys project.

In order to achieve this goal, the models developed for the case study presented as part of the previous work (based on a Victim-Rescuer scenario) serve as the starting point to manually obtain a self-adaptive component-based architecture, which we have implemented using Cecilia (a C distribution of the Fractal component model) and deployed on two e-pucks (low-cost mobile robotics platform). Through this implementation, we try to identify the generic rules that will allow us to obtain (by means of an automated Model-to-Text transformation) self-adaptive robotics software from the DiVA design-time models. The lessons learned from this experience are reported at the end of the paper, leaving the way open for further improvements on self-adaptive robotics. © 2011 IEEE."

MASs are based on autonomous entities that cooperate obtaining emergent behaviors, and can be useful for integrating open systems. However, the great diversity of agent-oriented modeling languages (AOMLs) hinders the understanding and interchange of MAS models. Most MAS concepts are shared among the AOMLs. However, these concepts have certain peculiarities in each AOML, such as the expected behavior and concrete syntax. This paper presents a metamodeling solution for the integration of the AOML diversity that uses the powertype pattern. In this pattern, the clabjects represent concept subtypes and are instantiated in models. MAS designers can change the clabject properties to indicate the peculiarities of each concept subtype, depending on the particular needs. Each designer can understand models of other experts by consulting the peculiarities of concepts in models. This solution is the Inter-methodology AOML, which is supported with a graphical modeling tool. This tool is created with a model-driven development approach. This work presents this AOML as a first step of a potential standardization process in the modeling of MASs. In addition, the Ingenias Development Kit tool, an existing agent-oriented software engineering tool, is adapted to export models to the presented AOML. The proposed Inter-methodology AOML is quantitatively compared with other AOMLs in nine different problem domains, and this comparison shows that the proposed Inter-methodology AOML can determine a higher proportion of concepts in these domains than other AOMLs. The presented AOML is also evaluated and validated with its mapping to FAML. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

While engineering of mechatronic systems and software engineering for embedded systems, multi-agent systems, and distributed systems are established areas, no solution for the systematic development of the outlined future generation of intelligent, distributed, embedded systems exists today. This is not simply a matter of composing the solutions developed for each of these area as some of their requirements are in conflict: E.g., flexibility and autonomy are to some extent at odds with predictability and safety. We propose to address this challenge by a modeldriven development approach which includes several advanced analysis and synthesis techniques. A restricted high level UML model serves as a basis for rigorous validation and verification to address the correctness and safety issues. Analyzing the high level models rather than the code is justified by synthesis techniques, which guarantee that all properties of the high level models also hold for the implementation."

This variability can be addressed applying reinforcement learning, which enables a robot to autonomously discover an optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. The process is carried out by measuring the improvements the robot achieves after executing each action. In this regard, RoQME, an Integrated Technical Project of the EU H2020 RobMoSys Project, aims at providing global robot Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics in terms of non-functional properties, such as safety, reliability, efficiency or usability. This paper presents a preliminary work in which the estimation of these metrics at runtime (based on the contextual information available) can be used to enrich the reinforcement learning process."

We build the world model in two steps: a structural model that constructs environmental factors (i.e., actors) and a behavioral model that describes actors' behaviors over a certain landscape (i.e., snippet). Abstract world behavioral test cases (AWBTCs) are then generated by covering the behavioral model using graph coverage criteria. The world model-based test generation technique (WMBTG) is used on an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV)."

Increased flexibility requirements in manufacturing processes call for more automation at the description and planning stages of manufacturing. Procedural models are good candidates to meet this demand as programs offer a high degree of flexibility and are easily composed. Furthermore, we aim to make our programs close to declarative specification and integrate automatic reasoning tools to help the users. The constraints come both from specific programs and preexisting knowledge base from the target domain. The case of human robot collaboration is interesting as there is a number of constraints and regulations around this domain. Unfortunately, automated reasoners are often too unpredictable and cannot be used directly by non-experts. In this paper, we present our domain specific language ''Tool Ontology and Optimization Language'' (Tool) and describe how we integrated automated reasoners and planners in a way that makes them accessible to users which have little programming knowledge, but expertise in manufacturing domain and no previous experience with or knowledge about the underlying reasoners. We present encouraging results by applying Tool to a case study from the automotive and aerospace industry."

With these new technologies, it will become possible to optimize the performance of traffic intersections so that wasted time at red lights and carbon emissions are minimized. Sensors, such as Doppler radar and traffic cameras, can use the data received at Road-Side Units (RSUs) from DSRC-equipped vehicles to assist with tracking and classifying all of the traffic approaching an intersection. In order to fuse information between multiple sensors, each sensor at the traffic intersection needs to compute the uncertainty about its estimate of the state of every vehicle it is tracking. In this work, we evaluate different tracking filters for their ability to estimate the state of a vehicle approaching a traffic intersection based on GPS data received over DSRC. We ran experiments with a vehicle equipped with a Cohda Wireless Mk5 On-Board Unit (OBU) and a high-precision GPS sensor to generate ground-truth data. We present a comparison of the performance of a linear Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, and particle filter configured with different kinematics models. The effects of measurement bias in the GPS data in DSRC messages is also explored; we observe that without any bias estimation, the performance of the track filters degrades significantly."

Existing image recognition methods mainly work on images with simple content (e.g., text lines with characters), but are not capable to identify ones with more complex content (e.g., structured code), which often follow a fine-grained grammar. To this end, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical Spotlight Transcribing Network (STN) framework followed by a two-stage “where-to-what” solution. Specifically, we first decide “where-to-look” through a novel spotlight mechanism to focus on different areas of the original image following its structure. Then, we decide “what-to-write” by developing a GRU based network with the spotlight areas for transcribing the content accordingly. Moreover, we propose two implementations on the basis of STN, i.e., STNM and STNR, where the spotlight movement follows the Markov property and Recurrent modeling, respectively. We also design a reinforcement method to refine our STN framework by self-improving the spotlight mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on many structural image datasets, where the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of STN framework."

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Using three key news items, this paper begins with a brief assessment of how the digital landscape has impacted the Canadian language services industry, with specific attention given to the relationship between social media and translation. While social media has generally created new opportunities for language experts (the ""good""), it is our hypothesis that there remains a significant lack of consilience between these two academic disciplines and industry sectors (the ""bad""). We believe that by underscoring the common ground between Translation Studies (TS) and Social Media Studies (SMS) (the ""interdisciplinary""), we may find ways of 'augmenting' [1] the status and role of professional human translators. A literature survey of the journal Social Media + Society (all issues from 2015-2017) shows that translation-which is central or at least related to online communication-is never addressed head-on, serving as an illustration of the lack of disciplinary dialogue between TS and SMS. As a way of starting and/or encouraging a more overt disciplinary dialogue, we explore three specific areas that will serve as the basis for an on-going research project on the subject of translation and social media: 1) the value-Added of professional translators in the context of social media monitoring; 2) self-Translation phenomena on social platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter; and, finally, 3) the necessity of human intervention in the translation of 'new' social languages such as Emoji. While empirical investigation is on-going, we believe this exploratory qualitative research speaks to anyone interested in intercultural communication in online settings (specifically on social media). The research can also be of interest to social platforms developers looking to embed translation applications within these platforms to optimize the user's experience. We leverage the methodological framework of Descriptive Translation Studies (DTS) and context-oriented research to better understand and chart translation phenomena in social media contexts."

This proposed problem can not only determine travel destination scheme, hotel choice, tour and resting break time, but also discuss the effect of differ resting break time on cost and time. Then, tourists can choose the travel planning according to their taste. A dynamic programming integrated with an efficient constraint inspection procedure is presented. To illustrate the practicability and validity through the use of our methodology, we present results from numerical experiments based on networks of the sites of Japan.

Trust in AVs, especially among pedestrians, is vital to alleviate public skepticism. Yet much of the research has focused on trust between the AV and its driver/passengers. To address this shortcoming, we examined the interactions between AVs and pedestrians using uncertainty reduction theory (URT). We empirically verified this model with a user study in an immersive virtual reality environment (IVE). The study manipulated two factors: AV driving behavior (defensive, normal and aggressive) and the traffic situation (signalized and unsignalized). Results suggest that the impact of aggressive driving on trust in AVs depends on the type of crosswalk. At signalized crosswalks the AVs driving behavior had little impact on trust, but at unsignalized crosswalks the AVs driving behavior was a major determinant of trust. Our findings shed new insights on trust between AVs and pedestrians."

UML has emerged as the de facto standard for modeling languages, supporting a wide range of modeling aspects and refinement levels. As a consequence, models can easily become too complex for manual verification and simple static analysis. This paper describes an approach to using the Java™ Pathfinder (JPF) software model checker to systematically verify UML state charts. While state machines in general are amenable to model checking, embedded actions and guards in UML state charts are not, since they require execution and analysis of a full programming language to cover the whole model behavior. Many UML development systems can produce code from diagrams, but this code is usually aimed at production systems, and is not suitable for software model checkers. Our approach is based on a specific translation scheme from UML state charts into Java code that (a) is highly readable, (b) shows close correspondence between diagram and program, (c) provides a 1:1 mapping between model and program states, and (d) imposes no restrictions about aspects and actions that can be modeled. We have demonstrated scalability and efficiency of this approach on hierarchical state charts with up to 1000 states, including verification of incomplete models by means of guided model checking.

In this paper, we present Tsmart, a self-contained toolkit to address these three challenges. Tsmart seamlessly integrates (1) a graphical editor to facilitate the modeling of the complex behaviors and structures in an embedded system, (2) a simulator for interactive graphical simulation to understand and debug the system model, (3) a verification engine to verify the correctness of the system design, and (4) a synthesis engine to automatically generate efficient executable VHDL code from the model. The toolkit has been successfully applied to designing the main control system of a train communication controller, and the system has already been deployed and in operation.

Unfortunately, many who attempt diagnostic self-tracking have trouble accomplishing their goals. People often lack knowledge and skills needed to design and conduct scientifically rigorous experiments, and current tools provide little support. To address these shortcomings and explore opportunities for diagnostic self-tracking, we designed, developed, and evaluated a mobile app that applies a self-experimentation framework to support patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in identifying their personal food triggers. TummyTrials aids a person in designing, executing, and analyzing self-experiments to evaluate whether a specific food triggers their symptoms. We examined the feasibility of this approach in a field study with 15 IBS patients, finding that participants could use the tool to reliably undergo a self-experiment. However, we also discovered an underlying tension between scientific validity and the lived experience of self-experimentation.

Inference of personal wellness-related attributes, such as body mass index (BMI) category or disease tendency as well as understanding of global dependencies between wellness attributes and users' behavior, is of crucial importance to various applications in personal and public wellness domains. At the same time, the emergence of social media platforms and wearable sensors makes it feasible to perform wellness profiling for users from multiple perspectives. However, research efforts on wellness profiling and integration of social media and sensor data are relatively sparse. This study represents one of the first attempts in this direction. Specifically, we infer personal wellness attributes by utilizing our proposed multisource multitask wellness profile learning framework-WellMTL-which can handle data incompleteness and perform wellness attributes inference from sensor and social media data simultaneously. To gain insights into the data at a global level, we also examine correlations between first-order data representations and personal wellness attributes. Our experimental results show that the integration of sensor data and multiple social media sources can substantially boost the performance of individual wellness profiling. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author."

Emojis are widely used by social network users when posting messages. Therefore, it is important to mine the relationships between plain texts and emojis. In this paper, we present a neural approach to predict multiple emojis evoked by plain tweets. Our model contains three modules, i.e., a character encoder to learn representations of words from original characters using convolutional neural network (CNN), a sentence encoder to learn representations of sentences using a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) network and CNN, a multi-label classification module to predict the emojis evoked by a tweet. Besides, attention mechanism is applied at word-level to select important contexts. Our approach is self-labeling and free from expensive and time-consuming manual annotation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms several automatic baselines as well as humans in this task."

We examined this tweet-based self-organization through quantitative and qualitative analyses of the information-sharing patterns of users during a two-week period surrounding the day when the climbers were reported missing. The data analysis process included descriptive and content analyses of 32,760 Persian and English tweets through generating hashtag, mention, and word frequency as well as topic modeling of the tweets. The results of the study proved the formation of a self-organized connective action by Iranians; previously non-affiliated people came together in an emergency, contributed to disseminating news about the event, and internally coordinated the flow of communication to reach their common goal. Iranian Twitter users worked toward making the disappearance of the climbers a trending topic on Twitter to draw global attention and used hashtags and mentions to coordinate their self-organized communication network toward reaching out to international news agencies and organizations for help. Our analysis suggests that while new media facilitated the participation of masses of people in this common cause, traditional media was deemed more effective in mobilizing resources and authorities and hence was reached out to for help disseminating information with the hope of accelerating the rescue process. The study provided insights into the dynamics of Twitter-based connective action in crisis communication in a non-Western socio-cultural context."

Two compounds, namely 1,2,4a,9-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5, 6,14b-octahydropicene (1) and 2,9-dimethylpicene (2) were isolated from n-hexane extract of the smokesaturated water. Their structures were determined by means of spectroscopic data including ESIMS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY). Dehydration of C-3 alcohols in boswellic acids (BAs) lead to aromatization of ring A followed by dehydrogenation and demethylation to afford triaromatic derivative viz., 1,2,4a,9-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5, 6,14b-octahydropicene (1) and finally penta-aromatic derivative viz., 2,9-dimethylpicene (2). Compounds 1 and 2 were screened for their antiproliferative effects on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. It was found that these pyrolysate products were capable of inhibiting cancer cell growth. However, this growth inhibitory effect was less when compared to their precursor AKBA (3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid). The antiproliferative activity is inversely proportional to loss of functional groups."

When combined with computer vision data processing techniques they are a good way to obtain high-resolution imagery and 3D information. As such, UAS can be advantageous both for agriculture and forestry areas, where the need for data acquisition at specific times and within a specific time frame is crucial, enabling the extraction of several measurements from different crop types. In this study a low-cost UAS was used to survey an area mainly composed by chestnut trees (Castanea sativa Mill.). Flights were performed at different heights (ranging from 30 to 120 m), in single and double grid flight patterns, and photogrammetric processing was then applied. The obtained information consists of orthophoto mosaics and digital elevation models which enable the measurement of individual tree’s parameters such as tree crown diameter and tree height. Results demonstrate that despite its lower spatial resolution, data from single grid flights carried out at higher heights provided more reliable results than data acquired at lower flight heights. Higher number of images acquired in double grid flights also improved the results. Overall, the obtained results are encouraging, presenting a R2 higher than 0.9 and an overall root mean square error of 44 cm."

Although the robustness of complex industrial control applications can benefit from formal modeling and verification, there remains a significant gap between formally verified models and real implementation. A model-driven development approach can be a solution to this problem. This paper aims to introduce a full-fledged model-driven integrated development environment, called UMIICA, for developing reliable industrial control applications. For this goal, we first determined the requirements imposed by the model-driven development process of networked industrial control applications. Based on these requirements, we analyzed the problems to be solved and designed the UMIICA tool according to the problem statements. Our proposed UMIICA tool is a full-fledged development environment for better productivity and software quality in our target application domain in that it incorporates whole model-driven development phases with cross-platform support and preserves the verified model behavior on the final implementation. As a case study, we constructed a three-axis cartesian robot testbed and developed an application for the testbed via the UMIICA tool. The evaluation results on our testbed also proved the effectiveness of UMIICA regarding the functional correctness and real-time performance guarantee of the resulting target application."

Publication rights licensed to the Association for Computing Machinery.Despite the noticeable progress in perceptual tasks like detection, instance segmentation and human parsing, computers still perform unsatisfactorily on visually understanding humans in crowded scenes, such as group behavior analysis, person re-identification and autonomous driving, etc. To this end, models need to comprehensively perceive the semantic information and the differences between instances in a multi-human image, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task. In this paper, we present a new large-scale database “Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)"" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing."

However, it is unclear how indicative these check-in traces are of real human mobility. Prior work showed that a significant portion of Foursquare check-ins did not match with the physical mobility patterns of users, and suggested that misrepresented check-ins were incentivized by external rewards provided by the system. In this paper, our goal is to understand the root cause of inaccurate check-in data, by studying its validity in social media platforms without external rewards for check-ins. We conduct a data-driven analysis using an empirical check-in trace of more than 276,000 users from WeChat Moments, with matching traces of their physical mobility. We develop a set of hypotheses on the underlying motivations behind people's inaccurate check-ins, and validate them using a detailed user study which includes both surveys and interviews. Our analysis reveals that there are a surprisingly large number of inaccurate check-ins even in the absence of rewards: 43% of total check-ins are inaccurate and 61% of survey participants report they have misrepresented their check-ins. We also find that inaccurate check-ins are often a result of user interface design as well as for convenience, commercial advertisement and self-presentation."

The mobile app market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with more than hundred of thousands of apps, and still increasing in number. This explosion of mobile apps is astonishing, given the short time span that they have been around. One possible explanation for this explosion could be the practice of software reuse. Yet, no research has studied such practice in mobile app development. In this paper, we intend to analyze software reuse in the Android mobile app market along two dimensions: (a) reuse by inheritance, and (b) class reuse. Since app stores only distribute the byte code of the mobile apps, and not the source code, we used the concept of Software Bertillonage to track code across mobile apps. A case study on thousands of mobile apps across five different categories in the Android Market shows that almost 23% of the classes inherit from a base class in the Android API, and 27% of the classes inherit from a domain specific base class. Furthermore, on average 61% of all classes in each category of mobile apps occur in two or more apps, and 217 mobile apps are reused completely by another mobile app in the same category. © 2012 IEEE."

The envisioned landscape of UWSN applications will help us learn more about our oceans, as well as about what lies beneath them. They are expected to change the current reality where no more than 5% of the volume of the oceans has been observed by humans. However, to enable large deployments of UWSNs, networking solutions toward efficient and reliable underwater data collection need to be investigated and proposed. In this context, the use of topology control algorithms for a suitable, autonomous, and on-the-fly organization of the UWSN topology might mitigate the undesired effects of underwater wireless communications and consequently improve the performance of networking services and protocols designed for UWSNs. This article presents and discusses the intrinsic properties, potentials, and current research challenges of topology control in underwater sensor networks. We propose to classify topology control algorithms based on the principal methodology used to change the network topology. They can be categorized in three major groups: power control, wireless interface mode management, and mobility assisted–based techniques. Using the proposed classification, we survey the current state of the art and present an in-depth discussion of topology control solutions designed for UWSNs."

This article introduces an approach to unify adaptation at design and at runtime based on Aspect Oriented Modeling. Our approach proposes a unified aspect metamodel and a platform that realizes two different weaving processes to achieve design and runtime adaptations. This approach is used in a Dynamic Software Product Line which derives products that can be configured at design time and adapted at runtime in order to dynamically fit new requirements or resource changes. Such products are implemented using the Service Component Architecture and Java. Finally, we illustrate the use of our approach based on an adaptive e-shopping scenario. The main advantages of this unification are: a clear separation of concerns, the self-contained aspect model that can be weaved during the design and execution, and the platform independence guaranteed by two different types of weaving. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

But the barrier to entry for making unmanned systems has fallen, with terrorist groups and crime syndicates capable of creating sophisticated robots using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. With the explosive growth of unmanned systems in the air, on the water, and underwater, the threat from misuse of these technologies increases. Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for ports, harbors, and protection of cruise ship and military marine assets has largely focused on threats above the waterline from more conventional threats like suicide boaters, or unauthorized entry. MDA at and below the waterline presents severe but not insurmountable challenges. Effective risk mitigation from UxVs involves a probabilistic approach to disruptive scenarios that reverse-engineers the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) likely to be used, based on the capabilities of rogue UxVs, and the skill level of their operators. Consideration of oceanographic and meteorological data available to the public in real-time or near real-time from observing systems is part of the risk prediction. Technical countermeasures that exploit rogue U×V weaknesses, and training of personnel involved in MDA, are logical components to close the gap.

The methodology exploits unsupervised time series segmentation to pursue two main goals: i) to support on-line decision making of drones and operators, ii) to support off-line analysis of large datasets collected by drones. The main novelty of our approach consists of its unsupervised nature, which enables to analyze unlabeled data. We investigate different variants of the proposed approach and validate them using an annotated dataset having labels for activity ""upstream/downstream navigation"". Obtained results are encouraging in terms of clustering purity and silhouette which reach values greater than 0.94 and 0.20, respectively, in the best models."

As a particular application domain, we are interested in doing this in open water, but the approach makes few domain-specific assumptions. Specifically, our system employed an unsupervised learning technique to train a k- Nearest Neighbor classifier to distinguish between images of different terrain types through image segmentation. A simple random exploration strategy was used with this classifier to allow the robot to collect data while remaining confined above a coral reef, without the need to maintain pose estimates. We tested the technique in simulation, and a live deployment was conducted in open water. During the latter, the robot successfully navigated autonomously above a coral reef during a 20 minutes period. © 2009 IEEE."

This work is part of a growing effort in HCI to develop surveys able to capture subtle nuances of the player experience. This model, UPEQ, was developed by transforming a self-determination theory questionnaire into a video game specific survey. UPEQ consists of three subscale of Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness, which, through two studies focusing on development and validation of the model showed significant correlations with other self-reported measures of sense of transportation to the game as well as enjoyment of and engagement with the game.

Usability assessment of drone technology with regard to land border security,"Hristozov S., Shishkov B.",BMSD 2017 - Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Business Modeling and Software Design,2017,SCOPUS,0,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NO,Exclude,,cp,,,,2-s2.0-85032896231,,"Some years ago, it would have been amazing to see a drone flying and behaving 'on its own', not knowing whether it is distantly navigated by a human or it is somehow autonomic. Currently we observe that: (i) Youngsters can easily buy toy drones and navigate them distantly; (ii) Military drones realize sophisticated operations in dangerous environments. This indicates for impressive advances in the technologies underlying drone developments, and that is all about ICT - Information and Communication Technology: current ICT is often embedded in services and/or devices. It is ICT that brings together hardware, software, and net-ware features, to enable useful solutions in different domains, such as aviation. As it concerns particularly drones, they represent complex devices comprising mechanical and ICT 'components'. Current drones can be piloted remotely. Further, being equipped with video cameras, they can provide fast access to images (and/or realtime videos) from a range of locations. Finally, advanced solar power supplies make it possible for drones to stay up for a very long time. Hence, this all makes current drone technology societally relevant. At the same time, many questions have not yet been answered (even though technology developed) - several of those questions are: Is current drone technology indeed reliable if used in critical (rescue) operations? How is the human navigating a drone responsible for what the drone would do? Who is responsible in the case of autonomic drones? Are current software platforms running on drones powerful enough to cover all possible situations that may pop up in the sky? To answer those and other related questions, it is necessary to 'step in the shoes' of a particular application domain since those issues are domain-specific - an answer concerning one domain is not necessarily valid for another domain. Hence, inspired by another paper in the current proceedings, we focus on land border security. We therefore aim at studying the usability of drone technology, with regard to the mentioned domain. For this reason, we firstly discuss drone technology in general and then we analyze its usability in land border security. This analysis is a contribution of the current position paper and inspiration for further research featuring the development of advanced context-aware drone platforms."

The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots."

This decentralized design strategy allows domain-specific issues to be accommodated by disciplinary analysts, while requiring interdisciplinary decisions to be reached by consensus. The present investigation focuses on application of the collaborative optimization architecture to the multidisciplinary design of a single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Vehicle design, trajectory, and cost issues are directly modeled. Posed to suit the collaborative architecture, the design problem is characterized by 95 design variables and 16 constraints. Numerous collaborative solutions are obtained. Comparison of these solutions demonstrates the influence which an a priori ascent-abort criterion has on development cost. Similarly, objective-function selection is discussed, demonstrating the difference between minimum weight and minimum cost concepts. The operational advantages of the collaborative optimization architecture in a multidisciplinary design environment are also discussed."

A second complementary survey was designed to probe about specific implications of performing with a system that facilitates live visual performance using multitrack audio. Analyses from 29 participants' self-reports highlight that the creation of audiovisual content is a multivariate and subjective process and help define where multitrack audio, audio-content extraction, and live mapping could fit within.

We present a theoretically based and empirically driven conceptual framework that addresses ER by proposing the use of visualizations of one's own and others' CAMM SRL multichannel data to facilitate learners' monitoring and regulation of emotions during learning with ALTs. We use an example with eye-tracking data to illustrate the mapping between theoretical assumptions, ER strategies, and the types of data visualizations that can enhance learners' ER, including key processes such as emotion flexibility, emotion adaptivity, and emotion efficacy.

This work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account. By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. © 2011 IEEE."

Coming with the digitalization of the ships, the success of MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) approach in software-intensive systems has led major industrial actors, of which Naval Group, to adopt MBSE for large scale projects. Nowadays industry has to go further, as more and more systems have interactions between each other in a systems-of-systems prospective, as well as MBSE is becoming more mature. One major challenge is to run an efficient system engineering process, because it will secure the following other phases of the product lifecycle. The system engineering system required for an Aircraft-carrier, frigates and submarines design and development involves numerous companies and teams, in several domains of expertise. The number and the complexity of the involved enabling systems are also important: Requirement and quality management tools, modelling and simulation tools, 3D design tools, etc. The communications between those teams, as well as the interfaces between those tools, are key points for a good design phase. So this paper proposes to take an MBSE approach to enhance these communications during the engineering phases, and to enable this integration between the different enabling systems that supports the engineering process. Another advantage is to establish the numerical continuum between the several engineering levels, domains and data, and to enhance automation of this integration by using the power of the model-based standards and associated frameworks. The innovation comes from the idea of engineering a new enabling system, able to define the system engineering integrated toolchain, tailored for each complex socio-technical system engineering process, and that this engineering is not performed by tool vendor, but by the target program team. So to define this system, we have tried to apply the fundamental principles of system engineering, onto the engineering system it-self, within a model-based approach: (i) the specification first, by giving more details on the motivations, second by expressing a simple set of requirements, modelled in a set of functions; (ii) the enterprise architecture modelling through a set of artefacts representing the System Engineering meta-model, and a first level of allocation; (iii) At last, as an early validation phase, where the relevancy and benefits of this approach will be discussed."

[Conclusion] To sum up, in this paper requirements are modeled based on GORE models. Then an SAS Quality model is augmented in the goal model. This embedded model is verified by OMEGA2/ IFX profile. The verified model is transformed to alternative architectural models by some defined transformation rules which is written in ATLAS language, implemented in Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)."

The developed framework as it is described here joins the concepts of location and user tracking as an extension for a new type of mobile information systems. The experimental framework prototype uses a WiFi network infrastructure to let a mobile device determine its indoor position. User location can be used by several types of applications. In first case the user location is used for data pre-buffering and pushing information from server to user's PDA. All server data is saved as artifacts (together) with its position information in building. The accessing of prebuffered data on mobile device can highly improve response time needed to view large multimedia data. In second case the user location information is used for crisis management in large area buildings. Real-time position location can be used to track service personnel (e.g., police officers, rescue teams, fire brigades, etc.), lost children, suspected criminals, and stolen vehicles."

Therefore, the result of the decision making process is mostly related to the agent's situational awareness and its adaptation to the new context and situation of the environment. A sound estimation of the situation requires a clean understanding of the operational domain, not only the data taken from sensors. In this paper, it is aimed to improve decision making by increasing the situational awareness of an agent by incorporating the decision making mechanism with the prior knowledge about the problem domain, such as the existing rules. Specifically, an existing adaptive decision making architecture, which is based on the deliberative coherence theory, is adopted to be driven by situational awareness. Moreover, a case study incorporating unmanned surface vehicles that are aware of the international sea traffic rules is demonstrated."

The individual utility functions are then combined in real time to solve the global problem. Although these techniques can perform well empirically, they sacrifice optimality. This paper proposes an approach inspired from multi-fidelity optimization to learn a correction term with a neural network representation. Learning this correction can significantly improve performance. We demonstrate this approach on a pedestrian avoidance problem for autonomous driving. By leveraging strategies to avoid a single pedestrian, the decomposition method can scale to avoid multiple pedestrians. We verify empirically that the proposed correction method leads to a significant improvement over the decomposition method alone and outperforms a policy trained on the full scale problem without utility decomposition."

Materials and Methods: The monitoring system consists of an implantable silicone capsule (diameter 2.3 mm), containing a dedicated microchip with pressure sensors and signal-processing circuits as well as an antenna for wireless data and energy transfer using 6.78 MHz transponder technology. Three self-expanding legs at one end of the capsule served as a mechanism to lock the capsule at an arterial branch. A flow model, driven by a ventricular assist system, was used for testing and optimizing the implantation equipment, for checking the anchoring mechanism and for ensuring transmission of the measured pressure to the readout unit. In-vivo experiments were performed in 8 minipigs (weight 25 to 30 kg), with three capsules placed in each minipig via the femoral artery using a dedicated 8-F sheath/pusher system. Follow-up was by CT angiography for up to 6 months after implantation. Results: Flow model tests revealed a maximum deviation of pressure and heart rate measurements of 5% from the reference measurements. Signal transmission was reliable over a distance of 3 to 4 cm. Fluoroscopically guided in-vivo implantation of the capsules was simple and straightforward. In arteries with a diameter of 5 to 6 mm, the capsules were permanently fixed with one or two legs interlocked in side branches and without occlusion within 6 months. Three capsules developed a small non-occlusive appositional thrombus attached to the downstream (leg) part of the capsule. Conclusion: Our in-vitro and in-vivo experiments demonstrate the feasibility of wireless transmission from a capsule with a sufficient resolution of the sensor output signals to determine blood pressure and pulse rate. As long as the vessel diameter is wide enough, arterial fixation of the capsule does not induce thrombotic occlusion of the parent artery. With respect to future clinical applications, further refinements of the transmission technology are needed to extend the transmission distance between capsule and reader antenna. The technology of intelligent implants has further implications, such as monitoring of other physiological parameters, and the design of a control loop, which may be used for therapeutic feedback."

Different from traditional vehicle modelling, a novel data-driven identification method for vehicle handling dynamics is proposed, which can avoid the problems of the under-modelling and parameter uncertainties in the first-principle modelling process. By first-order Taylor expansion, the nonlinear vehicle system can be linearised as a slowly linear time-varying system with fourth-order. In order to identify the derived identifiable model structure, a recursive subspace method is presented. Derived by optimal version of predictor-based subspace identification (PBSIDopt) and projection approximation subspace tracking (PAST), the identification method is numerical stability and gives an unbiased estimation for the closed-loop system. Based on standard road tests, the proposed modelling method is proven effective and the obtained model has good predictive ability. Additionally, it is noted that the model obtained from the initial phase of straight driving is just a mathematical model to describe the relationship between input and output. And when the vehicle is steering, the model can converge to a stable phase quickly and represent vehicle dynamic performance."

Most of the solutions are based on sequential methods that make inference according to current information. In contrast, we propose a deferred logical inference method that makes a decision according to a sequence of observations, thus processing a spatio-temporal search on the whole trajectory. One of the drawbacks of deferred logical inference methods is that the solution space of hypotheses grows exponentially related to the depth of observation. Our approach takes into account both the kinematic model of the vehicle and a driver behavior model in order to reduce the space of the solutions. The resulting proposed state model explains the trajectory with only 11 parameters. The solution space is then sampled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that uses a model-driven proposal distribution in order to control random walk behavior. We demonstrate our method on real video sequences from which we have ground truth provided by a RTK GPS (Real-Time Kinematic GPS). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a sequential inference solution (particle filter). © 2010 Yann Goyat et al."

Although existing schedulers are capable of executing several instances of the same model, the challenge is to provide mechanisms for creating parameterised models akin to function calls. Since recent task planning algorithms can synthesise behaviours as LLFSMs with parameters and recursion, it becomes necessary to have a useful operational tool that produces compiled executables for such behaviours. Moreover, parameterisation allows replication of generic system components, reducing overall design complexity. We produce safe mechanisms to set actual and formal parameters for multiple, concurrent instances of the same behaviour. We achieve the parameterisation of behaviour models analogous to a procedural abstraction and discuss its advantages and disadvantages on formal verification."

This problem is not only limited to the maneuver since the recovery might lead the system to an unstable state if the performance is critical. Design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) by using the uniform design (UD) experimental method represent a tool to study the performance of the aircraft without the full analysis of the dynamics of flight. In a specific simulation context described in this paper, encounters between two representative general aircraft, a Cessna 172 and a Twin Otter, in a Phi (\phi) maneuver are simulated. From the encounters, a diving avoidance maneuver is developed in a mid-air collision circumstance. The recovery is later observed and analyzed when the aircraft remains in a safe area while it waits for the thread to be removed. Assuming that the computer model is accurate and the simulation stable, the metamodel using UD provides an optimal combination of commands for all the scenarios with a minimum discrepancy. The implications of this paper are seen in the flexibility of this method owing to its adaptability to fit any computer model and simulation scenario. This feature is currently being used to study unmanned aerial vehicles and their interactions with other human-piloted aircraft in the same environment with the purpose of developing critical avoidance maneuvers."

A hybrid driving scheme is achieved by combining of a pneumatic proportional valve based pneumatic drive and a piezoelectric actuator bonded to the flexible beam. The system dynamics models are obtained based on system identification approaches, using the established experimental system. For system identification of the flexible piezoelectric manipulator subsystem, parametric estimation methods are utilized. For the pneumatic driven system, a single global linear model is not accurate enough to describe its dynamics, due to the high nonlinearity of the pneumatic driven system. Therefore, a self-organizing map (SOM) based multi-model system identification approach is used to get multiple local linear models. Then, a SOM based multi-model inverse controller and a variable damping pole-placement controller are applied to the pneumatic drive and piezoelectric actuator, respectively. Experiments on pneumatic driven vibration control, piezoelectric vibration control and hybrid vibration control are conducted, utilized proportional and derivative (PD) control, SOM based multi-model inverse controller, and the variable damping pole-placement controller. Experimental results demonstrate that the investigated control algorithms can improve the vibration control performance of the pneumatic driven flexible piezoelectric manipulator system."

Landmarks are not preselected or otherwise defined a priori; they are extracted automatically during a learning phase. To facilitate this, a saliency map is constructed on the basis of which potential landmarks are highlighted. This is used in conjunction with a model-driven segregation of the workspace to further delineate search areas for landmarks in the environment. For the sake of robustness, no semantic information is attached to the landmarks; they are stored as raw patterns, along with information readily available from the workspace segregation. This subsequently facilitates their accurate recognition during a navigation session, when similar steps are employed to locate landmarks, as in the learning phase. The stored information is used to transform a previously learned landmark pattern, according to the current position of the observer, thus achieving accurate landmark recognition. Results obtained using this approach demonstrate its validity and applicability in indoor workspaces."

The end-to-end process automation in life science automation demands comprehensive systems integration in heterogeneous, hybrid automation environments. Already at the early stages of the development of such solutions exists a great need for simulations of process execution. The presented simulation solution, interesting also for other target industries, is an important tool to an early staged quality assurance, to a definition of the components related automation demand and a validation of the process model. This visual simulation system shows the potentials of a BPMS-based automation using an animated process model, application simulations of the distributed automation and information systems, controlled video sequences or application screenshots and corresponding detailed information. It supports the argumentation for process-controlled, model-based applications, which transform the currently autonomous sub-systems and isolated applications into an overall system with a comprehensive, reproducible process control and monitoring.

In the near future, unmanned vehicle will be widely used the driving data of which needs monitoring carefully. The data of vehicle speed is important for analyzing the driving conditions and predict the danger of traffic accidents. When the road construction department judges a section of road as accident-prone areas, monitoring device will be installed to monitor the driving conditions. The algorithm proposed in this paper is used to extract vehicle speed from video. Gray matching method is used to lock the target vehicle. Weather the shooting device is drone or the installed monitoring device, the vehicle could be extracted with the video and will be tracked. The computing unit stalled in the shooting device will calculate the speed of the target vehicle based on frame difference. According to vehicle dynamics, the obtained vehicle speed could be used to calculate the condition of both vehicle and driver. The rolling resistance coefficient and air resistance can be calculated with the change of the speed. In the future, this technology will be used to detect the condition of each smart car on a specific road section. This algorithm provides a new way to obtain the vehicle speed and continuously monitors the vehicle conditions in a section of road. With the progress of visual recognition technology, speed recognition accuracy will greatly improve. During our study, the shooting device is installed on the flyover to record the track of the vehicle. The video is framed and grayed to obtain the vehicle speed. Compared to the actual speed, the error of the vehicle speed calculated with this algorithm is below 11.2%."

This is particularly important in conjunction with model-driven development, which is highly prevalent due to its numerous benefits. We use vectors of finite-state machines (FSMs) as our modelling tool. Our FSMs can have their transitions labeled by expressions of a common sense logic, and they are more expressive than other modelling approaches (such as Behavior Trees, Petri nets, or plain FSMs). We interpret the models using the same round-robin scheduler which is integrated into the simulator. Execution on a platform is exactly the same as in the simulator (where sensors and actuators are masqueraded by proxies) and coincides with the generator of the Kripke structure for formal model-checking. In three ubiquitous case studies we show that our simulation discovers issues where those models were incomplete, ambiguous, or incorrect. This further illustrates that simulation and monitoring need to complement formal verification. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We conducted an iterative design process, driven by our collaborator's domain specific goals in analyzing self-tracked sleep data. The final visualizations feature a unique spiral clock radial design and interactive controls for ordinal data. We ran a survey with three sleep clinicians to assess the effectiveness of each visualization type. In our user study a sleep clinician also performed a mock in-patient session, which demonstrated their effectiveness in a clinical setting. The new visualizations prove more effective in achieving the domain specific goals of sleep clinicians in comparison to previous efforts from similar work."

One key challenge posed by Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DASs) is the need to handle changes to the requirements und corresponding behavior of a DAS in response to varying environmental conditions. In this paper we propose a visual model-driven approach that uses the i* modeling language to represent goal models for the DAS requirements. Our approach applies a rigorous separation of concerns between the requirements for the DAS to operate in stable conditions and those that enable it to adapt at run-time to enable it to cope with changes in its environment. We further show how requirements derived from the i* modeling can be used by a domain-specific language to achieve requirements model-driven development. We describe our experiences with applying this approach to GridStix, an adaptive flood warning system, deployed on the River Ribble in North Yorkshire, England. © 2007 IEEE."

EASTADL is an architecture description language dedicated to automotive embedded system design with focus on structural and functional modeling. The behavioral description is not integrated within the execution semantics, which makes it harder to transform, analyze, and verify EAST-ADL models. Model-based techniques help to address this issue by enabling automated transformation between different design models, and providing means for simulation and verification. We present a way of integrating architectural models and verification techniques, which has been implemented in a tool called ViTAL. Consequently, ViTAL provides the possibility to express the functional EAST-ADL behavior as timed automata models, which have precise semantics and can be formally verified. The ViTAL tool enables the transformation of EASTADL functional models to the UPPAAL PORT tool for model checking. This method improves the verification of functional and timing requirements in EAST-ADL, and makes it possible to identify dependencies and potential conflicts between different vehicle functions before the actual AUTOSAR implementation. © 2012 C.E.S.A.M.E.S."

These hardware configurations consist of actuator and sensor elements which are controlled by system software that consists of over 35 million lines of code. To minimize the cost of testing and system integration, software simulators of hardware configurations are used - acting as virtual hardware platforms on which the real control software can be executed and tested. An important aspect in such simulation and testing is material flow (specifically wafer flow) in the machine. To support the effective and efficient realization of simulators covering material flow, we defined a domain specific language (DSL) for modelling the hardware configurations to be simulated, and used a model-driven engineering approach to generate the software components implementing the simulators. The DSL can be used to specify not only nominal (i.e. good weather) behaviour but also simulation based fault injection scenarios. The overall approach reduces the cost of early hardware-software integration and enables simulating scenarios that cannot be executed on real machines because they are difficult or hazardous to carry out. © 2012 C.E.S.A.M.E.S."

Even though the ubiquitous text-based communication through forums, chats, emails and social media is easy to use and process it shows significant lack of expressivity. Despite the proliferation of voice-based and video-based teleconferencing solutions compensating the communication gap in textual channels the contemporary digital communication systems struggle to deliver close to face-to-face group communication experience. Therefore, major government and citizen meetings and hearings have to be held in person to ensure quality discussions. In this paper, we argue that multi-modal communication enabled by the emerging, affordable and accessible VR technologies creates an opportunity to integrate the majority of mainstream channels into one communication platform."

Waterfall is too slow to react to such changes, and therefore, there is a growing emphasis to adopt Agile development concepts in the automotive industry. Ensuring requirements trace-ability, and thus proving functional safety, is a serious challenge in this direction. Modern cars are complex cyber-physical systems and are traditionally designed using a set of disjoint tools, which adds to the challenge. In this paper, we point out that multi-domain coupling and design automation using correct-by-design approaches can lead to safe designs even in an Agile environment. In this context, we study current industry trends. We further outline the challenges involved in multi-domain coupling and demonstrate using a state-of-the-art approach how these challenges can be addressed by exploiting domain-specific knowledge."

However much of this conventional research has been carried out in the retail and manufacturing industries where much of the work is repetitive. How does this model fit for the new developing areas of professionals classed as 'knowledge workers' [2], to which the profession of project management belongs where task variety and a high level of work autonomy already exists. This paper looks at one aspect of the survey carried out across the Consulting Business Group, Halcrow Group Ltd that of how the recognition scheme was perceived after its introduction by members. There is much evidence that contingently administered recognition schemes can be as powerful a reinforcement to increase employee performance as a part of a total reward model, Driven by this proposition, Consulting Business Group has been carrying out a pilot recognition scheme across all its 523 staff, over a 6 month period from April to September 2005, predominantly targeted at the staff in the UK and this report deals with the feedback from those staff and the underlying implications for knowledge workers such as project managers. We received 281 responses (Total staff number of 523) from 27 offices worldwide representing a return of 54% which means that the results of this survey are statistically relevant and can be said to represent the opinions of the business group. The overriding factor was that only 3% of this group of staff would be against us continuing this scheme and believe, despite the variety of viewpoints, philosophies and concerns, that it is a worthwhile initiative. However where the most interesting discrepancy was the way in which money was viewed rather than as a hygiene factor that the research had indicated it appeared to be a 'badge of status with implications for self-esteem and exercise of influence and directly related to work effort and job satisfaction. In fact they appear to use pay as a means of evaluating their net worth to both the organisation and the external labour market checking constantly for discrepancies between the two. © 2006 IEEE."

With semi-autonomous vehicles, this is not yet the case. In our work, we aimed at finding out what we can learn from pilots' current experiences for the domain of autonomous driving and what implications can be derived. We conducted three in-depth interviews with pilots to investigate how pilots currently handle handover situations to and from the autopilot, which information is relevant for this transition to be successful, how pilots react in critical situations, how handovers are trained, and how flying and handover skills are maintained. We compare the gained insights with the domain of autonomous driving and reflect on implications for handovers and (de)skilling. Our findings suggest that the AUI community can learn from aviation in areas such as situation awareness, transparency of system status, the need for a primary drive display, calibrated (dis)trust, and driver training."

Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R&D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys."

The application requirements varies from low rate sensor data flows to high data-rate image and video transmissions. Coordination and communication among robots are vital for various applications in such indoor deployments. Due to the dynamic work-flow and mobility of the robots, wireless networks are being used as the underlying mode for communication among robots and between the robots and other network devices such as routers, gateways, etc. However, wireless behavior of the last-mile communication link is greatly affected due to various indoor constraints such as multi-path, blockage, interference, and mobility. In this paper, we present characteristics study of the wireless communication behavior in large-scale and complex multi-robot indoor systems. We also validate and select appropriate channel model for such robotic indoor communication systems. Through extensive simulations on ROS-OMNeT platform, we demonstrate effects of obstacles, their material types, node’s mobility on the communication coverage as well as Signal To Noise Ratio (), Packet Reception Rate (), and throughput performances."

Such a collaborative environment requires a seamless wireless communication infrastructure to share information among different entities. Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) have evolved as the next generation network for improving wireless services by providing inherent multi-hop communication. WMN deploys a routing protocol at layer-2 and provides multi-hop communication functionality with reduced overhead. Although various routing protocols are proposed for WMN, they are not very effective when WMN are applied as underlying technology in a multi-robotic wireless network. This is because of the fact that unlike any other wireless mobile device, robotic devices have certain task work-flow to follow and hence their mobility and connectivity with adjacent robots depends on their tasks at hand. In this paper we propose a new path selection and multi-hop routing protocol called Robotic Wireless Mesh Protocol (RWMP) for indoor multi-robot wireless networks. Through our NS3 based simulations we compare performances of the proposed model with existing state-of-the-art models and show that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art schemes in terms of average throughput and end-to-end delay."

However, driving behavior estimation is a major factor neglected in these methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel contextaware methodology for estimating the driving behavior in terms of future vehicle speeds that will be integrated into the EV battery optimization. We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) called Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-Aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and the route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-Adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-Term estimation. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-second speed prediction which is improved by 27% compared to the state-of-Theart. Hence, it can achieve up to 82% of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement possible by the ideal methodology where the future vehicle speed is known."

In this paper, we propose a preliminary investigation of how decisions regarding robot-to-human communication modality in mixed reality environments might be made on the basis of humans’ perceptual and cognitive states. Specifically, we propose to use brain data acquired with high-density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the neural correlates of cognitive and emotional states with particular relevance to adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI). In this paper we describe several states of interest that fNIRS is well suited to measure and that have direct implications to HRI adaptations and we leverage a framework developed in our prior work to explore how different neurophysiological measures could inform the selection of different communication strategies. We then describe results from a feasibility experiment where multilabel Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Networks were trained to classify the target mental states of 10 participants and we discuss a research agenda for adaptive human-robot teams based on our findings."

Technological developments reduce the active role of the human driver that might, nonetheless, require occasional intervention. To what extent are drivers allowed to dedicate resources to non-driving work-related activities? To address this critical question, the workshop brings together a diverse community of researchers and practitioners that are interested in questions as follows: what non-driving activities are likely to be performed on one's way to work and back; what is a useful taxonomy of these tasks; how can various tasks be studied in experimental settings; and, what are the criteria to assess human performance in automated vehicles. To foster further dialogue, the outcome of the workshop will be an online blog where attendees can contribute their own thoughts: https://medium.com/the-mobile-office."

These are externally powered devices that can apply external forces on human limbs to assist the limb motion. Human walking pattern involves repetitive and well coordinated lower limb movements. A cable driven leg exoskeleton (CDLE) uses actuated cables to apply external torques at anatomical hip and knee joints. However, a cable can apply only pulling force on a body which limits a cable driven system functionality compared to a conventional robotic manipulator. Noting that a CDLE is proposed to assist in complex lower limb motion during walking We present workspace analysis of CDLE considering planar and spatial leg model. Human walking data were used for the analysis and to study the feasibility of CDLE architecture for human gait rehabilitation."

The plasticity of a UI denotes its capacity of adaptation to the context of use while preserving its quality. The efforts in plasticity have focused on the (meta) modeling of the UI, but the quality remains uncovered. This paper describes an on-going research that studies a method to develop Self-Explanatory User Interfaces as well as an editor that implements this method. Self-explanation makes reference to the capacity of a UI to provide the end-user with information about its rationale (which is the purpose of the UI), its design rationale (why is the UI structured into this set of workspaces?, what's the purpose of this button?), its current state (why is the menu disabled?) as well as the evolution of the state (how can I enable this feature?).

Following Brooks, we refer to states as behaviors. A novelty of this language is that behaviors are treated as first class objects in the language and thus they can be passed as arguments to other parameterized behaviors. The language has template behaviors which allow generalized behaviors to be customized and instantiated. This makes the language quite flexible in terms of programming styles. An example of its flexibility are presented, followed by a description of the challenges in the language design. © 2012 IEEE."

Studies have been conducted on a wide variety of issues encompassing XML. In the use of XML for wireless computing, the focus has been on investigating ways to efficiently represent XML data for transmission over a wireless environment. We propose a middleware, Xstream (XML Streaming), for efficiently streaming XML contents over a wireless environment by leveraging the rich semantics and structural characteristics of XML documents and by flexibly managing units containing fragments of' data into autonomous units, known as XDU (Xstream Data Unit) fragments. The concept of an XDU is fundamental to the operation of Xstream. It provides for the efficient transfer of documents across a wireless link and allows other issues and challenges pertaining to wireless transmission to be addressed. By fragmenting and organizing an XML document into XDU fragments, we are able to incrementally send fragments across a wireless link, while the receiver is able to perform look-ahead processing of the document without having to wait for the entire document to be downloaded. In this paper, we propose a fragmenting strategy based on the value of the wireless link's Maximum Transfer Units (MTUs). In addition, we present and evaluate several packetizing strategies, i.e., strategies wherein a collection of XDUs are grouped into a packet to optimize packet delivery and processing. At the receiving end of this process, a reassembly strategy incrementally reconstructs the XML document as XDU fragments are being received, thereby facilitating client application implementation of look-ahead processing. © 2004 IEEE."

The obligation of Zakat is unanimously agreed upon all schools of jurisprudence. However, these schools hold distinctly different opinions on various subjects of Zakat such as the amount that constitutes nissab, the categories of wealth and the rate of Zakat that applies to each category. But, one of the Zakat issues is how to calculate the amount owed to pay. Indeed, the calculation of Zakat demands serious consideration and is often the subject of great discussion. To address these issues, several ZCP (Zakat Calculation Platforms) were developed. These platforms form a necessary tool and play a crucial role in Muslims life. They support the Muslims in calculating their Zakat easily, correctly, quickly and accurately. However, this multitude of platforms, although it has strengths, it also presents some weaknesses. In order to overcome the drawbacks of previous platforms, a new ZCP must be developed to fulfill the Zakat calculation requirements. For this, in this paper, we provide a general overview of different existing ZCP. Then, we analyze some existing approaches enabling to develop such platforms. The analysis also provides limitations of each approach to evaluate whether they fulfill the Zakat calculation requirements. Finally, we propose a process based on Zakat Calculation Models (ZCM) named ZCMGProcess (Zakat Calculation Models Generation Process) and a tool supporting this process named ZCMGenerator (Models Generator of Zakat Calculation)."
