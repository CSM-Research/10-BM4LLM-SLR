an editorial, abstract, technical report etc.).
- IC2: The paper is written in English.
- IC3: The paper was published in 1999 or later.
- IC4: Title or abstract of the paper indicates that it is related to software engineering.
- IC5: Title or abstract of the paper indicates that at least one code smell/anti-pattern plays an important part of the study.

- IC7: Abstract or full text of the paper indicates that it focuses on code smells/anti-patterns in programming languages.
- IC8: Abstract or full text of the paper indicates that it focuses on code smells/anti-patterns detection using source code.
- IC9: The paper does not focus on techniques for resolving code smells/anti-patterns.
- IC10: The paper does not focus on using code smells/anti-patterns as predictors of other code or project traits.
- IC11: The paper focuses on detection/prediction of code smells/antipatterns.
- IC12: If the paper is a chapter of a book or conference proceedings publication, its authors have not published a study under the same title in a journal (we want to include the paper once and it may be expected that the journal version includes more details).
