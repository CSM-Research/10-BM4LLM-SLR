10.1016/j.jss.2023.111796,"A systematic literature review on source code similarity measurement and clone detection: Techniques, applications, and challenges","Inclusion criteria:

- IC1: At least one keyword of the article existed in our search string.
- IC2: The title or abstract of the article is about the measurement or application of the source code similarity.
- IC3: The article has been cited at least once. This criterion was considered only for articles that were published
before 2021. Using this condition, we could ensure other researchers in the community have considered the paper.
- IC4: The conference paper is considered if it does not have any journal extension. Otherwise, only its journal extension was included since articles published in a journal often offer more complete descriptions than their conferences counterpart.

Exclusion criteria:

- EC1: The articles repeated in citation databases were removed. We kept only one version of each duplicated article.
- EC2: Articles whose main text was written in any language other than English or only their abstract and keywords were in English were eliminated.
- EC3: Articles whose total text was less than three pages were removed. After reviewing them, we removed these articles and ensured they did not contain significant contributions. If there are good clues in these articles to find other suitable topics and articles, we consider these clues while applying the inclusion criteria and snowballing phases
- EC4: Articles that did not directly discuss a source code similarity measurement approach in their abstract were removed. For example, some papers have discussed binary code similarity.
- EC5: The papers that had not proposed an automated approach for source code similarity measurement were removed. We excluded these articles since the similarity measurement technique was necessary when classifying methods.
- EC6: Theses, books, journal covers and metadata, secondary, tertiary, empirical, and case studies were removed.
","The paper is included, if all inclusion criteria match. If the paper matches any exclusion criteria, it is excluded."
